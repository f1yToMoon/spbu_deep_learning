4,"Problems at home, it hurts.","Hi, my name is Scott and i'm 16 years old and today I had my first real thought about suicide. I live in a pretty wealthy family with a loving father. My mother on the other hand is a bit different. I'm not sure whether or not her love for me is real and I can't tell at this point. Whenever something bad happens it's always my fault and I get no say in the matter. I'm called worthless, a pile of shit, and given no food at points because she says ""oh yeah I have to feed you till you're 18, oh well."" She has threatened to kick me out  of the house numerous times and says when I turn 18 im never to live in the house again and I have to support myself and never ask her for anything. I just started my sophomore year and I've been doing decently well but I just bombed a chemistry test and my mom went at me for it. She tells me that she would rather give the money to another kid who wants to try when she KNOWS that I love school and want to do it. I'm a decently popular kid, I play lacrosse, i'm going to wrestle, and  have a good amount of friends. But after today, it feels like there is no future to me and that I don't see myself going anywhere, I just can't envision my self at all even if I try. I have 2 older sisters who are 27 and 30 and are both successful ( one is in medical school and the other is working for Deloitte). It feels like her expectations for me are based on what they did, and they were INCREDIBLY smart. I just don't know what to do and I really need help."
5,Guys it’s my first c-word day :),"This sub won’t let me say the c word :( But thats ok. It’s my first pastry day on reddit and yeah it makes me really happy :) Anyways, enjoy your days and thanks for reading"
6,I like big girls and I cannot lie,That’s how it be. There is always some ugly like me waiting for you.
7,1 week without self harm but it still doesn't feel good.,"I used to self harm a lot back in 2014. I stopped then after help from my best friend. But recently things got worse. I mean a lot. To that extent where i started to self harm again. But this whole week I have kept myself from self harming. Instead I made a bullet journal, studied, submitted assignments on time and tried being a lot more productive. But deep down there is this nagging voice telling me that everything would be cushed and turned to dust again one day. I am just scared to build up hope. I am scared of again being pushed to the end of the tunnel I tried to crawl out from. "
8,Anybody tryna love me,And not leave me if i make a minor mistake ofcourse
9,Can't sleep. Maybe this will make me feel less suicidal.,"I need to vent, and maybe someone has some words to make me feel less like shit. I took a year off of school because I was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia and needed to sort that out. I thought it was sorted out for a while, until school started a week ago. I feel like my chest is in a vice. Every little thing just gets to me. Getting out of bed is nearly impossible, the only thing close to it is falling asleep. Ive only had 4 days of classes and I already skipped 2 days worth. And I'm only taking 2 classes and a lab. Skipping makes me feel even shittier, but I just couldn't get out of bed. Now I'm worried I'm gonna fail my classes, which I know sounds stupid since I only started a week ago, but it just keeps compounding. I'm also in a long distance relationship that is killing me. Maybe that isn't a good way to put it, as talking to him every day is one of the only things keeping me from hoing insane. But not being able to touch him, feel him, and actually be there for him is torture. That also stresses me out. And what complicates things is I'm a guy too. Only a few people know I'm in a gay relationship, and I'm scared to tell my family and my fraternity brothers. It just feels like all this is just too much to handle. I know it really isn't a lot, but it is still getting to me. I feel like a bitch for not being able to handle these small things. I feel like I'm never going to succeed in life if I can't handle 7 fucking credits. Someone asked me where I see myself in 5 years today, and that made things even worse. I don't see myself in 5 years at all, I just assumed I'd be dead, and it scared me. I subconsciously decided I would kill myself before then. I just feel like killing myself would be easier, because I'm sick of every little thing being so hard. I'm fucking exhausted and don't know what to do to get myself out of this. I just want to be fucking happy. All I know is I have to go to classes tomorrow and ask what I missed. It's only like 2 hours out of my day but I'm still dreading it. Maybe if you read this you have advice. I'm by no means going to kill myself tonight, but I feel like I'm going to impulsively do it soon. It would be so easy and end my constant fucking battle with my brain. I guess that is it. Thank you for reading, and I'll probably be up for a while if you decide to comment."
10,"Girls of /r/teenagers, a question for you...","I was just reading through one of the other posts asking if girls can see/care when guys have boners, and that got me wondering... when girls get turned on, do you feel like people can tell? I mean, i believe one of my friends who is a girl mentioned sometimes she feels like people can tell because of getting wet and everything, but idk. What do you say?"
11,Winter induced depression?,"I find that I cheer up as soon as the sun comes out. I'm not completely ""cured"" but the last few days have been really sunny and I've been in good spirits. 

I read somewhere on reddit once of a woman who had been diagnosed with a form of depression that worsened during the winter months because of the bleakness and lack of sunlight. She said she felt like 2 different people depending on the seasons. I can relate. In the winter I feel more down then ever and it gets progressively worse each year, yet when the sun comes out its like I was never diagnosed. 

Is this an actual thing? "
12,My crush pet my head like you pet a cat :D,"It was very fun! Only happened for a few seconds, but I enjoyed it so much!!! 

It felt so good, the petting was amazing, and his hand was soft and warm, and I just set there shocked because he did it out of the blue! 

He even said that he'll do it again in the future because I liked it so much

Today we had a fight, but it's ok because we made up. Im just glad that he always puts up with me.

Also he doesn't like me back, which makes me very sad, but I understand. And hopefully he will one day, or I will let go, which ever comes first, probably the second option..

Felt like sharing oki bye :D"
13,Dating sucks change my mind,Like I cannot bear the thought of being romantically and emotionally involved with one specific person??? Idk why but it's not good
14,"I'd be okay with dying now, thank you","It's bullshit, isn't it? Being told that it would be selfish to attempt again when *so many people care*. Fuck off with that. Fuck off, I don't want to hear it coming from someone who doesn't even bother to check up on me. I fucking want to die, they don't know that. Do they only ""care"" to keep up appearances and because that's what is to be expected?.

I don't even care much for myself anyway. I fucking hate myself. I'm convinced it would have been better for me to die last attempt. Or the one before that. I'm fucking sick of this when I know I'm only going to continue being alone. I know that because I don't bother reaching out, and in turn, no one bothers keeping tabs with me. Fuck, I'm done."
15,It finally happened,"After 2 years and a half of liking her, my crush gave me her phone number and the best part? She has 69 in her number and I've got 420 in mine"

18,Well I’ll damned,It’s 11:29 for me and I’m tired. I’ve been going to sleep at 2-3 am the past few nights. Might be able to fix my sleep schedule tonight.
19,SHE SAID YES BOYS!,I asked my Mom if I was adopted and she said YES!
20,"When you think it can’t get worse, it always does!","I’ve had a relatively rough life, most relationships I have had have ended in either me being too edgy and actually opening up and then them leaving, or me leaving them thinking I am going to go off and kill myself. People think I’m too young to be suicidal. It’s been years, and I do not think there is a light at the end of this tunnel. It’s been a long and really dark one. I’m too far down the rabbit hole to be saved at this point. I just want to die. I want people to be happy, no one has to deal with my endless whining anymore. No one would have to see my hideous face. Just, no more."
21,I cant ask out a girl.,"Its not a confidence issue or something, I just can't. Reason being.. she lives in like this like place for people that're mentally ill, I dont remember. Doesn't let her leave or do anythkng. Ive known her for like a month, we always sit together, she laughs at my jokes, she even said she WOULD go on a date with me.
I can't even wait for her to get out of it, because whem she does, she goes to another city two and a half hours away. What the hell do I do? I feel as if god's just denied me the perfect girl for me, she's literally everything i'd want in a partner. Seriously.
Help?"
22,"No matter what I do, I end up miserable","It's been going on for pretty much as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, myself and others (parents, school etc.) used to boil it down to me having a temperament. Basically what would happen is no matter how good I was at something, how well I did something, no matter what I was doing, at one point or another I would do something, stub my toe or make a mistake or whatever, and I would become insanely frustrated, to the point of feeling physical pain. This would result in me becoming very angry. A few years ago I went to therapy and I've pretty much learned to control my anger, at least outwards, but that's just made everything worse.
Now, whenever this happens (and it happens pretty much every day), I become severely sad (I want to say depressed, but I have not been diagnosed such, and I'd rather not selfdiagnose) and generally feel that ""I'm such a waste of space, I'm absolutely shit at everything, no matter what I do, I'll never suceed at anything (including life), nobody really likes me, and never will (doesn't help I've never been in a relationship in my life)"" etc. 

At this point, I don't know what to do. Every time I try to explain it to anyone (so-called friends and whatnot) I pretty just get told to get over it, or ""you have it pretty good, stop crying"" and such things people on this sub are well familiar with. 

I'm not sure what the point of this thread is, I guess I just need to vent. It got really bad today, it happened afternoon, and it's 3:30 AM now, still not gotten any better, and I'm the closest to committing suicide now that ever. I won't do it, I don't have the balls, but it's not exactly a great feeling.

Anyway, just thanks for reading and listening I guess"

But in school it was ITCHY ASF so as soon as I got home I went to the bathroom and cut a little more off but it was still itchy so I waited for the night to go away but it didn’t so I decided to search for my dads razor and I found a open and most likely used but clean razor and cream so I got naked and creamed it and shaved it but there was still some of it left so I cleaned the razor and put more cream and went hard against it but it didn’t change so I decided to go against the direction of the hair and the next thing I know, BLOOD IS EVERYWHERE!


There’s blood on my dick, legs, balls, and ass so I cleaned the razor and buried it deep in the trash can and cleaned the cream can and put it back at the exact position and I tried to clean the blood but it keeps coming and idk when it’ll stop coming so I know it’s 4am at least for me but please help

The purpose of this note file is to give insight into my probable mental status at my time of death. I will detail both my rationale for how and why I plan to kill myself, as well as a sort of self summary of my thoughts and general mental state.

#Method
A checklist of sorts for what I want in a preferred method of suicide.
----------------------------------------------------------------
Preservation of organs for donation

ZERO risk to Innocents. (Collateral damage is unnaceptable)

Preferably quick death with not much more suffering

Guaranteed death, so I can make arrangements to be found and leave goodbyes without the risk of surviving and having to deal with all that shit.

(Optional) If the option presents itself I'd prefer to die in a way that benefits someone. (Taking a bullet, getting stabbed fighting a mugger, etc)
------------------------------------------------------------------
I have put careful consideration into what method I would ideally use. I have decided against chemical assisted suicides. Despite the ease of access to the necessary supplies, the risk they pose to Innocents and emergency responders is too great to justify. As for the thermite I have access to, I've deemed it far to painful and damaging to property to use.

Hanging is not an option, the tree has been chopped down and I have no access to the proper rope. Also I'm not motivated to do so due to the percievable pain and suffering.

Gunshot is also not a valid method due to multiple facts. For one, the guns are locked in the safe. And two, suicide using my brothers or mothers gun would cause too many issues for them. It would have legal issues, and ruin my brothers military career.

Walking into traffic hasn't worked in my previously, rather half hearted attempts. And upon further thought, it is not a very promising method. The success rate is not high enough, and I wouldn't want to traumatize an innocent. Not to mention the damage to organs and mental trauma to the driver.

Suicide by cop is the most promising. Death is guaranteed if I draw my metal airsoft pistol on a cop. Although it's not ideal for preserving organs.

Best case suicide if I can suffer a bit of extra pain, for the greatest good that could come of it, take no painkillers or meds of any kind, lay in an ice bath, inform a hospital that I'm an organ donor and that I'm dying, gash my jugular and fade off while I bleed out. This way my organs have the best chance to be used for donation. But this is honestly unlikely.

#Things I think are wrong about me

I haven't cried for three years or so (sparing a few situations) EVEN WHEN MY FUCKING GREAT GRANDMOTHER DIED. AND I WANT TO CRY SO MUCH!

The thoughts I think are obviously wrong. I have so many illogical and conflicting thoughts, my brain does not fucking work correctly.

I haven't dreamed in years.

Everything makes me fucking anxious, why the fuck does everything make me nauseous and anxious. 

My sociotrophy.

I feel removed from my own mind. I'm just watching my thoughts carry out actions.

Nobody can even tell that I barely function

Every social interaction fucking hurts, even when it goes well. And the ones that don't, make me want to fucking die.

I care less about myself than I care about my coworkers or even distant aquentences

I want to die.

I'm just fucking weird and don't contribute to society.

My brain dosent work right.

Everything feels like my fault even when I know it isn't

Cognitive dissonance

I have thoughts about wishing I suffered an accident that made me loose X sense/limb

I hate my body, not me, my body. Maybe me and my body now that I think about it.



#Social Life
(Most of this I don't believe, I've just been told these things)

I appear entirety normal, I'm well received, and have a good number of friends. I'm extremely well liked at work, for certain reasons. Mainly because I'm a chronic people pleaser and offer myself out to everyone on sheer impulse, and so far haven't let anyone down yet. But if I had kept working there and gave them the time I would have. Despite wanting to be a slacker like they said everyone else was I felt obligated to give more than I could every day. And they loved me for that.

My friends are mostly eitheir childhood neighbors who I played with or kids who used to bully me but I befriended by being better at hating myself than they were. My friends who weren't bullies introduced me to their friends and that's now my closest friend group. 

They have often described me as ""hillarious"" ""one of the nicest people I've ever met"" ""a great person"" ""just a relatable and funny guy"" ""fucking smartest dude I know, and funniest"" ""a good friend"" ""a good person to talk too, everyone loves him""

What confuses me about all this is, I'm not very funny, the humor I have is a coping mechanism for how sad I am. I'm not very smart, I'm just above average in a few niche topics that they find impressive. I'm actually a fucking idiot. And me being a good person is just because I've convinced other people that I'm good as a side effect of me trying to prove to myself that I can do good things maybe. 

The only inherent truth in any of that is that I'm a good listener, cause again, I care more about other people. I like to listen, even if I often can't help. And apparently people like that so whatever.

My family knows I'm fucking weird, I don't know much about their thoughts about me. I've picked up some tidbits from my brother though. None of them even notice most of the issues I have in my head, they only got wind of it because I started joking about suicide at school. And it scares me how easy it was to convince them nothing was wrong. Litterally me saying shit like ""fucking kill me"" ""I want to die"" ""holy shit just put a fucking bullet through my head"" are all commonplace. 

My dad apparently thinks I'm gay because my neighbor Jason raped me (he didn't, my dad is just a fucking dolt.) And my mom thinks I'm gay because I hate all women (Probably heard me shouting some sarcastic joke to a friend, I do hyperbolic characters). 

Speaking of parents, my mom is narcissistic and emotionally manipulative. And my dad is a fucking idiot hypocrite who would very frequently hurt me. My dad's first response to any disagreement was to threaten violence. And if you asked questions after you'd get smacked. Also, chew too loud? Get smacked hard across the back of your head and told you were chewing with your mouth open (when you weren't). Wake him up by being a loud kid cause I can't fucking hear and I'm ADHD? Get whatever you're playing with broken or threatened to break. Play a game on the PlayStation when you're not doing good in school? Have the PlayStation thrown into the backyard and broken without saying a single word. (Same person who constantly complains about how mom wastes money) complain about being dragged outside to go do shit (my feet hurt from walking, what do we need to do here, etc) litterally smack your 10yr old in the head with your wedding ring backward and cut his forehead badly. Also every day he'd sleep all day and when he was awake would just argue with us and insult us, also shout constantly. Oh and if you tell even the whitest lie he'd hit you ie: ""are there candy wrappers behind your dresser again?"" ""Nooooo"" *gets thrown into the dresser when he moves it and sees wrapper*"" And the reason I'd lie in these scenarios is because despite always saying ""if you tell the truth I won't get mad"" The few times I came to him before he even knew about something that happened, and told the truth he'd shout and get mad and hit me.

My mom is nowhere near as bad as him, but she still would constantly be calling us selfish, saying nobody does anything for her, that we never help her (we do a good number of chores, and she constantly causes more work for herself by being garbage at time management and always being late for everything) bassically nothing was ever her fault, she was late cause she was waiting for us, it's our fault. And she'd constantly act like she told us to do something when she never did. Like ""I told you hours ago to go do X"" to convince us that it's not her fault that something was missed because she was late, it was actually OUR job. 

The jist of it is I fucking hate my dipshit dad, and I don't trust my mom. My brother has his own issues but I trust and rely on him, even though I'm filled with regret when I remember all the shit I did to him (stole $20 from him,  constantly argued with him, insulted him, lied to him.) But despite all that, he still genuinely cares about me supprisingly. Even though I don't deserve anybody who cares about me.

So there you have it, I've summed up my problematic waste of an existence. Maybe someday I'll get what I deserve."

44,I feel like the world is a bowl of creamy potato soup and I'm a stupid fucking ant that crawled in and is now slowly drowning.,"Spent four hours today trying to remind myself not to die. I'm so alone. I'm broke. I am getting tired of being tired. I just want to go to the beach. I just want to smoke weed and play guitar. I was happy when I did that before. I could be myself. Why is that too much to ask for? Can I just go somewhere and grow my own food and go fishing? I should probably sleep soon... I wasted two fucking thousand dollars on this stupid bullshit course I'm taking. Two thousand dollars would have gotten me like six or nine months of hanging out on a beach in Central America. Then I could have figured something else out. Like working online or something. I don't fucking know. But now I wasted it all and I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I don't want to die, but I want this shit to stop. I hate myself for wasting everything. I feel like I don't deserve to keep living. I feel disconnected, like I'm watching myself die. I've felt that way for a long time now.

Why are there always bruises on my legs? I don't remember getting them. There's this big one on my shin that's been there for months."

50,I can't keep pretending i'm normal,"I feel i'm about to collapse, i can't take it anymore. Why do i struggle so much with simple things, like driving, having a girlfriend, keeping everything in order, and understanding instructions. 

I'm so tired of doing such a great job at pretending i'm normal just to eventually dissapoint everyone because i cant keep up appearances anymore. My job is falling appart. I always struggle with new ideas, i take too long to understand things and on top of that my boss sucks at explaining things.

I feel like running away and leaving everything behind because i know im too much of a coward to kill myself. I've been too much of a coward my whole life feeling anxious about everything and im so tired of it.

Im so dissapointed in myself, i was given everything in life, raised by a loving family, and everyone always told me i was so bright, but i knew i was broken on the inside. Always struggling to make friends, always wondering how exactly everyone around me knew what to do in certain situations while i had no clue what was going on.

I dont want to wake up tomorrow ... i hate so much being such a failure,..it hurts so much i cant live up to my fathers legacy, i wish he was alive to ask for his guidance... and it breaks my heart to dissapoint my mother, both had to sacrifice so much for me.

I dont know what to do anymore. I dont know how to move on when my mind just can't process things."

All I need is this fucking job and maybe things will even out but I'm just not sure any more...I push all my friends away because I'm a fucking pyscho. I've tried to go on a date 5 different times since I moved home and I scared off all of them. I hate everything and everyone and everything makes me mean, spiteful and agressive. Yeah sure I can make plenty of online friends but I'm sure if they knew the true me, they'd shut the door one me. I just want a normal life. I want a career and an education a boyfriend who will one day be a husband. Maybe kids one day. But my future looks so bleak. I can't even get out of bed in the morning some days.

I feel like im just a failure despite knowing it's not true but i can't stop feeling like I failed in life. Here i am who put so much energy in getting a good grade but all my hardwork wasnt enough and now i dont even know if i can get into a good university for further study. I don't have anyone in my life anymore who i talk to freely.... i could never openly talk to my family without getting into a debate where i have to accept that i was wrong if not it's just going to go on and on... the only friend that knew almost everything about me was my ex and now i cant even talk to him about anything anymore... I feel like the only thing i will be good at is being a housewife but i know given my luck and nature, i would mess that up too. Got several job rejections already and given the situation dont know how long it will take for me to get one.

Bit of a crush, still trying to figure out if I like her for sure.

So I met 3 classmates yesterday, the 3 of them were classmates at 6th grade while I was  new student at 7, and so I sat next to this guy I get along with when we ate at a restaurant, (two guys two girls) well guess who kept silently staring at him every time he smiled? I'm ranting here bcs the girl I was with is the only person who knows my feelings rn, and shes nosy as fuck that she knew there was something between him and I. I'm so grateful that I didnt give him my reddit account because if he stalked this I would spill the goddamn feelings all over the place.   


A lesson i learned here is that smile every time you talk to a girl. (dont go overboard guys it'll look weird) IT WILL MAKE THEM GO CRAZY IF THEY LIKE YOU. They'll also unconsciously hang out with you more if they're feeling something. If you're into them as well you can make a move but dont be too obvious (some girls want to keep their feelings a secret from the person they like until they feel like confessing) so yeah thank you for coming to my session of simping over a guy because of his smile."

70,My parents are fucking morons,"So I have an assignment that is done and ready to turn in and my dad barges in an hour after I go to sleep and yells at me for shit I don't do. To give background he does this shit all the time and I'm known to not do chores when told. 

So he is there yelling at me and shit and he does the same shpeel about taking my computer away and all that. Then he goes ballistic because I don't want to talk because I'm already sobbing because he is calling me useless and stupid and shit and that I'm a bully to people (I'm really not and if I do I usually apologize the next second for being a little rude.) 

Then he rips my computer out from where it was and he got to a cable and he wasn't able to fucking look with his eyes and see that you push down on it to unlock. So instead this insane asshole just fucking starts trying to rip it out and seeing it must not be important and that I don't need it. After the computer is on the ground, he talks more about how I'm useless and then he says I know what I need to do from now on and I don't respond because I haven't had time still to process anything. So he fucking kicks my around 700 dollar pc that I pretty much bought myself. My mom's stands at the doorway and I'm saved. He picks it up BY ONE OF THE FUCKING PARTS and hauls it out. 

He justifies all this because I have a fucking c that will go up tomorrow. And earlier I was thinking to myself that I want to sit down and talk to my mom about my mental state spiraling out of control because of him and that I just wished they'd ask how I'm doing from time to time instead of your grades are shit. I have all fucking a and b and one c that I already told them why. 

Is my dad just fucking insane or am I a super disobedient teenager fuck all that does nothing for anybody. I just need to vent and some comforting because I don't even know if my dad even cares about me. He doesn't drink and is known for his anger but his head is too far up his ass to admit it. He never beats me but sometimes I'd rather get hit than be called useless for an hour by my dad."
71,My brother always wears a mask and never comes out of his room,"TW: mentions of ab\*se and s\*\*cide

&amp;#x200B;

My brother (17m) and I (19m) come from a household with a history of abuse. I currently struggle with PTSD and have been attending therapy regularly for over a year now to cope. Our home situation is infinitely better than it was 3 years ago, and we no longer face abuse or danger on a regular basis. However, the wounds of the past still linger even today and it greatly worries me on how it's impacted my brother. 

He has not been outside in almost a year other than to throw trash out. He always wears a full face mask on his face and barely even speaks to my mother and me. He loves playing games like Dead by Daylight and continuously watches videos relating to DBD and all horror related content. He has discussed suicide on more than one occasion and views life as a simulation and how it doesn't matter to make your own memories since everyone is connected and he only needs the experiences of others to live his life. 

He also exhibits severe anger issues and can become violent during an outburst. He almost never has outbursts, but when he does they make me fear for my well-being and I've contemplated calling the police because of how severe they get. 

In all his years at school he's been in special education classes because he seems to be on the spectrum, but never officially diagnosed. 

I don't know what to do at this point. He's going to be 18 in May and graduate from high school and finally have free reign over his life. He never gets sunlight, never gets to see beautiful nature, has 0 friends, and seems to just want to wither away into nothingness, waiting to die.

I'm tired of seeing him like this, and part of me is afraid that he may have a violent outburst in the future that ends up carrying severe consequences. I want him to have the happy and fulfilling life I know he's capable of having despite all the shit we went through growing up.

If anyone has any advice, I would greatly appreciate it."

76,I dont know anymore,"Hey there reddit. I wanted to leave this here because i want to get it out of my chest, as i am now having a breakdown and i am extremely sad at the moment. I wanted to share my story so hopefully someone might give me advice, and just by posting this gives me comfort. 

I am 17 years old, and i live with my mother and ny brother. My father works overseas. Since elementary school i was often bullied. I was called names, got excluded in games others were playing at, etc. And because of that i had difficulties having friends, changed ny personality to fit in, and just didnt care about everything. I had bad grades, i was still being bullied, i was often scolded by my mother. In grade 9, a day before my birthday, i was picked up by my mom after school. She was talking to somebody but was talking too long. I got mad because that day it felt like shittier than usual. I pushed her a little bit, not that hard that would make her fall down, but i made her move only a little bit. Now my mother has had enough of me at this point and was so angry at me that she hit me with her umbrella multiple times and said to me that she regrets having me as her child, that she made a having another son instead of me. I cried and cried all night. A year after that i had a girlfriend. My parents forbid me from having one as they wanted my brother and i to focus on our studies. When they found out they grounded me for about two months. But i kept my girlfriend and started seeing her in secret. We fought alot because i was venting my frustration and anger at my parents, my studies, and myself. Eventually she got tired of me and broke it off. Of course i was heartbroken but that made me had a couple of friends. 

Now you might be asking why i'm posting this in this subreddit, well its because i think i starting to get depression again. I thought i overcame it but i feel like its starting to lodge itself on my brain again. I struggled to make my grades good but i feel like my mother still doesnt see my worth as her child. She cares for me and my brother but i still feel she doesnt want me as her child. I have no one to vent to because im an introvert and i have trust issues so i posted my story here. I was suicidal last year but now i'm not. Sorry if i seem like a crybaby teen who just wants attention, because i know others here suffer more than i do. But still, if you're still reading this i thank you with all my heart.

Now, cuntface is a beautiful girl that I have bowled (Yeah I bowl, wanna fight about it?) with for about 2 years. In the last month, me and her kinda had this back and forth thing going. We flirted while we were bowling, texted eachother cute shit and all that good stuff. One day, she asked me to come over when her parents werent home. Nothing happened, we kissed and watched Modern Family. After I left though, she texted me and told me that she wanted to fuck. This caught me by suprise, didnt know she got down like that. I was really excited, but everytime I tried to hang out with her she was busy. We kept flirting and stuff but then out of no-where, she stopped talking to me, stopped texting me, and just was really cold to me. I fell HARD for this girl. It got to the point where she was the only thing I thought about. I didn't want to get out of bed all week. I begged her when I saw her bowling to give me 10 minutes of her time, and she said no. She finally decided to text me tonight asking me why I've been such an asshole to her recently. I pored my heart out, said fuck a bunch of times, got called an asshole and eventually we got around to her telling me that she ""got over me"". She also tells me that a guy made her whole week better and that she's in love. I'm usually a very level headed guy, but I may have freaked out when I read that. 

TL;DR : Cunt gave me blue balls and broke my heart. I'm mad and sad and stuff. "
79,How Do You Deal With A Friend Who Is Boy-crazy,"So My bestfriend (lets say her name is Aimee) is super boy crazy its the only thing she talks about and we have been friends for almost 2 years and last year we were like the same person we were bookworms and enjoyed talking about books and series and other nerdy stuff during lockdown when schools and basically the whole country shut down we did not have much contact from March 2020 to August 2020, school reopened in July but since she has asthma she only came back in August and we had alot to talk about and she told me she had a huge crush on this guy Cole who was in our class that year fast forward next year school reopened in February instead of January which meant I did not have to go to school the day before my birthday (12 January) and on the first day I noticed physical changes for example she no longer wore her glasses and she lost a some weight and she also did something to her hair.

She began to talk about boys Cole in particular, she would not stop talking about him and she would say he's so cute or he's so smart and stuff like [that.](https://that.In) The thing is Cole was not her only crush she also had a crush on 3 other guys at the same time. Our friends and myself included told her the truth about her crushes. Her crush, Cole was a complete asshole and a big jerk who was very disgusting and filthy minded, he is Deputy-Head boy and so damn full of himself her second crush was a player who was totally going to fail the grade and the rest where ok.

One thing I must point out her parents DO NOT allow her to date so she has had 3 boyfriends I think and I have noticed that her grades have dropped and I am really worried for her, if she sees her crush walking down the corridor she would hide behind me and scream and I have had enough. Most of our friends have not been hanging out with us lately and I believe its from her boy obsession that totally getting out of hand and when ever I tell to focus on school and put boys aside she would say ""Ahh, you sound like my mom"".

Am I overreacting ?, Am I acting like a mom?

Is Aimee right?

What should I do to snap her out of it?"

84,Day 1 of posting my daily logs,"I write my important thoughts of the day sort of like a diary. I've decided to start posting my entries. Today was day four so I'm gonna write 1-4 today and tomorrow post day 5

**Day 1**

Mom says i should have a spiral notebook to write my thoughts down in, so I'm doing this instead. 

It's been no more than 10 minutes of the day and I already want to hurt myself. I now realize what people mean by saying it's an addiction. I've been hurting myself by digging my fingers into my arm and although it hurts, there's nothing all that harmful in the long run, so the fact I'm justifying it makes me want to do it more. It's like I'm a teenager who's recently been exposed to weed. I was scared to do it, and scared to tell people I did it, but now that it's over, I want to do it again so badly. I'm scared that nails won't do it anymore and I'll feel the need to be even more harmful to myself. I'll be using knives instead of my fingernails, heroin instead of marijuana. Mom said that if I have these thoughts then I need to tell her, but it's after midnight, she'll probably just be mad at me for being up late. Also what's the point in comforting me over thoughts? I'm not actually hurting myself, I just want to.

One of my friends says their depression is worse than ever and that last week they cut themselves for the first time in years. We had a conversation and they mentioned that they would probably kill themselves if they had a bad enough breakdowns. I don't know what I would do if they died. If any of my friends died. I stayed home when my cat died just because I didn't want to face people and I wanted to be alone. I guess I couldn't do that now, so maybe instead I would just leave my room less often. Or maybe I'd leave more often because (sister) is constantly in our room talking to (sister's gf). That would probably make me feel even worse. Maybe I'd just lock myself in the bathroom for days on end.

I don't want to just hurt myself, I want to throw up. I used to say that because I was nauseous a lot, but now it's not that I feel like I'm going to throw up, I want to do it. I want to go to the bathroom, lean over the toilet, and force myself to throw up. I don't know why, nothing about that process sounds appealing, it sounds kinda gross actually. I'd probably do it if I wasn't too lazy. I guess that's the good thing about being a couch potato. ""I would have an eating disorder, but my bed is just super comfortable."" 

I guess I stay in my bed because it's the only place I feel safe. All I need is the sound of the fan and to get under the covers and I'm in my own mini paradise. That is until (sister) comes in. She's doing nothing wrong and I feel like she thinks she is, which makes me feel worse. I leave the room any time (sister) comes in because I feel like I'm bothering her. I'm always watching a funny video trying to feel something besides complete utter nothingness and I feel like I'm interrupting her, even if she isn't on the phone with (sister's gf).

Two of my friends came out to me almost in the same week. One came out to me as transgender and the other came out as bigender. They were both girls when I became their friend, and technically one of them is still a girl? I don't know how bigender works. I asked if I can just refer to them with ""they them"" pronouns because there is no way I'll be able to tell if they're a girl or a boy. They said it was perfectly fine but it's going to take me so much time after thinking of them as a girl. I feel like a bad friend for that. It doesn't matter how much I reassure myself that it's going to take time and I'm doing fine, I feel like I'm not doing enough in the way of changing the way I think about them. They said they've felt like this since about January. I don't understand how someone can go 13 years of their life thinking they're a girl and then just change their mind and say ""nope, I'm still a girl, but I'm also a guy, it just depends on what I'm feeling."" That's probably a transphobic mentality. More proof that I'm a bad friend.

I've accepted that there's no such thing as free online therapy. Everything that says it has free therapy just lets you open the site for free and then you pay 100 dollars for your first session. Mom and Dad have both hinted at giving me therapy, and I've said that I would really like it, and then we do absolutely nothing about it. I don't want to rush them though. ""Why won't you just spend 100s of dollars on me already?"" I probably don't even need therapy. I mean, I've never been professionally diagnosed, as far as I know this is all in my head. 

I think that's a other reason I want to self harm; I want to prove that I'm not making this up. Not just to the people around me but to myself. No person without depression would hurt themselves. If I hurt myself that means I'm genuinely depressed, and free from being a terrible person by trying to get people to pay attention to me and my non existent problems.

I've decided to not write about every time I think of hurting myself. Mom said that everyone has bad thoughts like that, they just don't stick to them. So that's what I'll do instead; I'll write it down if I'm contemplating it. So far I've only contemplating hurting myself once today, which I've already written about. I'd say that's good except I don't think I should want to hurt myself at all.

I'm just remembering that I wanted to write this so that's what I'm doing. (sister) came into our room earlier and asked if I minded her being in there. Of course I said I didn't, but I did mind. I wanted to be left alone in the comfort of the bedroom, but I didn't say that. I'm writing these logs with the intention of showing Mom, so Mom, if you're reading this, don't tell (sister) I don't like it when she comes into our room.

I'm happy I'm writing these. I've wanted for so long to start writing a diary, and this is sort of the same thing.

Ok now that I've gotten that out, basically what happened was that (friend) found out that I did the talent show without her, and that I didn't tell her. She's really mad at me. Not just mad, she's sad, and hurt. I hurt her. I hurt my friend I'm a terrible friend I should have told her but I was scared she'd be mad at me I'm a coward I'm a terrible person I'm a terrible friend I didn't deserve to be in the talent show.

I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend I'm a bad friend

I need icecream I need to be numb. Numb is better than in pain. Maybe I deserve to be in pain. Icecream is bad for my acne anyways. If (friend) doesn't know I'm in pain she won't know I'm not in pain so it doesn't matter.
I'm getting icecream.

I didn't get as much icecream as I would have liked, but I got all there was left and hopefully it will make me feel better. 

I apologized to (friend) and she hasn't responded yet. She's probably giving me the silent treatment because she's getting back at me for being such a bad friend to her.

I finished my icecream. I don't feel any better.
I think now's the time to show mom the log for today.

Edit: icecream didn't make me feel better, but talking to (brother) did.

Listening to (brother), I realized that I can't think of him when he was in 8th grade, I can only imagine him as an adult. I wander if he remembers me when I was a pathetic helpless baby. I mean I guess I'm still a pathetic helpless baby, only now I'm 5'2 pathetic helpless baby.

I can tell that the phone call is close to ending. I'm scared for Mom to see this, but I can't wait for this to be over.

**Day 2**

I'm having a weird obsession with DID, it's just so fascinating to me and I don't know why. I think it's starting to annoy people around me.

I felt bad about not writing barely anything for like 60% of the day, but then I realized that's because nothing bad happened, which I guess is good. I don't think anything's happened today actually.

Ok well we watched the Willoughbys which was fun so I guess that happened.

(Embarrassing thing you guys don't want to read about. The jist is I thought I started my period)

Ya know what? Today was a good day! :3

**Day 3**

Went to the bathroom today, and I have not started my period. That's a win I guess.

So today was going pretty good, but now I'm just sad. Or maybe I'm just bored? Like I feel this sense of aching dread mixed with nothingness. I'm not sure why I feel like this, maybe I am just bored.

**Day 4**

I feel sick. Sort of? It's like that feeling I have when I feel hungry/ like I'm gonna throw up/ or existential dread.

Ok I ate breakfast and I feel better. I was probably just hungry.

(friend) FORGIVES ME YAY!!! Or maybe she doesn't? She just said that she's over what I did. I'm taking it as she forgives me.

I want to hurt myself again. No reason why, I just really want to sink my nails into my skin.

I feel the dread/hunger/nauseous feeling again.

I can't sleep.
I should probably start showing Mom my entries again."
85,There's never any rest.,"I just want to let off steam, don't think it's a little sad that in life, since you start going to school, there is never a real break, yes, there are vacations and all that, but they are fewer days than those you go to school, and on those school days, they put you to do activities, or they give you homework or both and well, you finish and have free time for the rest of the day after you complete them, but after all that, you have to get a job that will give you less free time, and you need it because if you can't pay your taxes, you can't get food, and practically, you can't get anything that needs money, so you have to keep working and working, no matter how stressful you get, because if you don't you'll end up living under a bridge."

89,I feel like one day my thoughts will make me depressed,"I've been searching for months on and off for a sound argument as to why humans have free will.

There is none.

Biologically we don't have free will. Everything we do is automated or done at a non-speaking, non-conscious level of ourselves. The only thing we can consciously do is reason, but even then our reasoning doesn't control our actions. Our actions are set to happen and then our brain comes up with a conscious reason for why we're doing what we are.

I still have hope that one day I can be convinced that I'm all wrong. That there is free will. That I have freedom of choice. That this isn't all predetermined - that the universe up to now and all the way into the future isn't a mathematical guarantee. But the more I search the more I realize it's the opposite. We lack free will. We lack choice. Our actions were bound to happen just based off how the universe was set into motion.

I worry that one day these thoughts will make me depressed. The only thing that distracts me from these thoughts are politics, sports, and friends, which is how I know I'm not depressed, or that I don't have OCD. But god damn if I don't feel depressed whenever I think about this shit."

Plus with the fact that I’m fat and not very attractive, I can’t even use looks to make up for it. So, I’m already giving up on making friends at this shitty fast food job I got. I’ll just do my time and then leave so at least I can get paid.

107,Life,"Posted this to a blog, but hell, it's better here.

But, eventually I slap on my fake smile and head to school, and forget all of the cuts and the wishes of death. All of a sudden I become the funny kid, the kid who people like, the kid that is ""confident"". I hate reality and drugs, but at least in a drug stupor I don't fantasize about shooting up my school or killing myself. Hell, half the reason I want to kill myself is because I know as soon as I can get my hands on a gun, a lot of people, including me, are going to die. The person my friend know, the person that I know, and the person that is supposed to be me is a facade. I love ""me"", but I hate myself. Had to rant, sorry."

109,The ground keeps rushing up faster everyday but I never hit it.,"My father and i have always had a very estranged relationship since he left me, my mom, and my sister. Since I've been pregnant and had my son, we've been working on repairing our relationship. On May 10th he told me he was dying, fast. As in he honestly did not know how long he had left so he's trying to visit by the end of the month fast. 

Exactly a week later, after I had told my boyfriend about this and he said he would be there for me if I needed help, after a week with no warning or signals, he dumps me. He says he has to focus on himself and can't balance his life with being a boyfriend to me. I had no one else to turn to. He was the only person who knew absolutely everything about me and really the only person I thought I could trust with my heart and feelings. I can't trust my family because they feel that anything shared in private is open season for the entire family. So I've been lost for a few weeks.

Toward the end of the relationship, I had reconnected with an ex boyfriend of mine. We broke up on amicable terms, he was leaving  to Japan for the navy and we were young. I told him that my ex and I had broken up and he also said he would be there for me. I had started to gain feelings for him but I was still confused because I didn't want to rush things having just been dumped not too long ago. He starts talking about coming to visit me when he's on leave and wanting me and my son to move to Dallas with him in a couple years, just like how we left off before he left for Japan. He said he had dropped everyone for me and I believed him. I thought things were looking up after being dumped.

Then I got a really good job offer with great pay as a nanny. I just found out that it was a scam and that I lost over $3000. I'm a college student and single mom living with my mom. I can't afford to pay $3000 to anyone for anything. I'm just absolutely devastated originally but I calmed down throughout the day and started to rationalize the situation and focus on how to fix it rather than dwelling on the fact that it happened. 

Then I found out that the guy I reconnected with didn't actually only want me. He hasn't talked to me in a few days so I decided to find his twitter to see if it was just me and he's been active on twitter or if he's just underway and didn't tell me. I found out there that he'd been ""subtweeting"" certain conversations kind of minorly insultingly but my feelings can be hurt very easily by people that I think I can trust. I also found out that he'd been flirting with other people and basically had another me back in Texas that he was actually going home to first before he came out to see me.

I just broke down. I just feel so used and worthless. I don't know what to do with my life now. I feel like I've let myself and my son down and that no one actually values me no matter how much I try. I thought things were getting to be so amazing after having to deal with my father who isn't even 40 yet and dying soon then having the one person who said he'd be there for me leave me high and dry without warning. I just feel like I want to die but I know my son needs me. I know that I won't do it because all it takes is for me to look at my son and I snap out, but I feel like I may get terrifyingly close. I see no purpose in living right now except him but now I have no way to support my son, I won't be able to clear the funds that I am being held financially responsible for after being scammed, I just want to fucking die right now. I'm so tired of living through hell. I have been kidnapped, raped, forced into prostitution, mugged, beaten viciously, and had one of my rapists children. I don't want to carry this around anymore. And recent events are just adding to the load and making the PTSD worse. I can't handle this right now."

113,Need Advice for my cousin,"Hi everyone,

I've also posted this to r/bullying but I also wanted your opinion. 

I have a cousin who is at 6th grade and she's been a victim of organised and systematic bullying throughout the year. But the whole thing reached to its peak last week when they invested her locker and her personal staff while she was staying at home. Then -as the bullies understand that they are wrong- they defamed her by saying that she'd wrote bad stuff about everyone without any proof.

There is this one girl behind all of it but she is organising the whole class (I really don't know how) against my cousin. They are also cyberbullying her through WhatsApp so basically my cousin can't have a moment in peace.

Today my aunt is going to school to talk to the principal. What do you recommend to do other than this?

A quick update: Before everything, I must note that I'm not from the US and my cousin goes to a private school. In my country, private schools have high tuition fees that only a wealthy minority can afford. Related with this, most students are ""spoiled"" children.
So, about what happened today, before my aunt went to the school to talk with the vice-principal, parents of the bullies (the ones behind the above mentioned investing lockers thing) went to the school and talked with the vice-principal. When my aunt went to her office, the vice-principal shocked her by saying that she'd found neither side gulity, my cousin should seek for a professional support (but not the bullies) and no punishment will be given to the bullies.

Now, as I said, it is a private school and all they care about is money rather than student wellbeing. So, they are reluctant to punish any students. Plus, parents of the bullies are more ""wealthier"" than my aunt so it is much easier for them to threaten or impress the school.
My aunt will talk with the principal tomorrow at 8:00 am but she is so upset with all this? Do you recommend anything else? What should she say to the principal?

Thanks again."

I had almost a full weekend planned, a nice hike, a movie and some ice skating.... but my housemate didn't send through rent on time and it came out of my account and it got overdrawn. I literally lost all the money I had for the weekend! So all those plans were cancelled and I've been sitting at home all weekend like a usless blob. I really hate how things like this happen and it just sends me into a depressive spiral, I was feeling ok, I just hate how emotionally fickle I am, one small inconvenience and I'mnot getting out of bed. I've forced myself to go out a couple of times and just walk around my neighbourhood, but it doesn't feel the same.
Anyway, I really hope everyone else had a better weekend than I did!"

125,i want to push myself to do it,"⚠️tw: self harm and smoking + gets kinda intense? i guess? idk, just stay safe please

❗️disclaimer: i dont condone self harm or smoking. if you dont do it, please dont start.

i dont want help because i dont deserve to get better. i almost just want to hurt myself enough and be so self destructive that i push myself to suicide. 

i hate myself so much i just want to get rid of myself. i want to get rid of myself so i dont have to be stuck with myself and to finally let people in my life live without my existence plaguing their day to day.

its so annoying because i cant kill myself just yet. i want do it at a certain age or at the very least when i live alone. i dont have either of those things yet.

for right now, i cut myself to punish myself and i want to pick up smoking to further ruin body, hopefully ruining my mind in the process.

its hard caring about anything (like the 3 or so classes im failing right now) when i plan on ending it in a few years anyways, so im always stressed but i just dont have motivation to do my assignments. i dont have motivation to start the process of learning to drive either even though i need to get a job, its so annoying.

i fly off the handle sometimes and its not fair to everyone else, i know its not. i dont mean to, i dont know why im so irritable sometimes, just someone talking to me can make me want to bang my head on a wall sometimes. ive gotten better at bottling it up though, so im not lashing out or accidentally hurting someone i care about (not physically, btw, i would never hurt someone like that). i apologize afterwards and then i punish myself by cutting. i need to be better though, i know i do. this is unacceptable. cutting is helpful though. i punish myself for getting angry and i take it out on myself instead, which makes me feel better afterwards. i dont like being angry.

im so fucking disgusted by myself and disappointed in me. i only get one shot at life and im constantly fucking everything up. its all my fault and im gonna pay.

i have to pay for being such a waste of life and a fucking plague. this is karma. i ruin everything so i will continue ruining everything, but it’ll be my everything. this is payback and i deserve nothing else, maybe worse than this.

i cant take it anymore. why did it pan out like this? 

im so fortunate. my mom has sacrificed so much to get my sister and i here to the states and give us a life so we can prosper and have better lives so we dont have to work as hard as she does. she suffers everyday giving us a better life and here i am wanting to throw it all away. what the fuck is wrong with me. all those years, all that money, all those tired painful long nights working to keep the house running, and i have the fucking gall to want to kill myself. im fucking disgusting.

my life is good, the people around me are great, the only problem is me. i am the problem. i need to solve it and leave them alone.

i want to bully myself into suicide. i want to abuse myself so much so there’s no chance i dont do it

tldr; loser wants to kill themself, dont worry, its for the best"
126,Comment your most controversial statement,I want this to be the most controversial post on this sub
127,Rambling of an attemptee.,"Just venting and talking to myself for a bit. If you have some advice I'd appreciate it.

You know, I've always felt that there was some sort of survivorship bias to attemptees. Just tons of stories of them not wantin' to kill themselves after trying to do it, and the cynical part of me thinks some of them are just saying that to avoid themselves getting institutionalized - if so, fair play. 

Of course, now as someone who has attempted, and failed... and attempted, and failed, again and again and again. I can say that to this day, I still very much want to kill myself. 

Of course, not everyone has the same outcome. To those attemptees who have found some sort of reason to continue living - out of some grand epiphany, some glimmer of hope, a realization of love and care, or perhaps out of fear of death, out of spite - I hope they're alright.

But for me, well, I have no fuckin' idea why I'm still here. What am I, just a meatsack _existing_? I know my worth, don't tell me ""Learn to love yourself"" because I do, I'm so sick and tired of people telling me that. I do love myself! I know myself enough to the point where I'm okay with the act of pullin' the trigger on my head if I had something to shoot with. I love myself to the point where I know that for me to be happy is to end it. 

Maybe I love myself too much then, huh? Kinda ironic.

A common thought brought up by people when discussing about offin' oneself is the thought of family. For me, it's complicated. Look, I know my family loves me, sort-of. Hell, my mother and an aunt of mine constantly make voice recordings asking me how I'm doing, if I'm alright, and they encourage me to talk to them if I had problems. While on the other hand, none of them are perfect either. Some of them I consider to be the absolute scum of the earth - an absolute deadbeat father who drank to death before he could even get to say that he loved his kids, an uncle as loud as a lion's roar and as invasive as a goddamn pest, yet can't seem to get his fuckin' grip with trying to have an actual career for his life.

Then I have this one, this _one_ fuckin' family member. They do everything, literally everything for the house. You'd think they'd be lovely, and they are - kinda. They do their job in the house wonderfully well, they don't have an actual paid job, or a spouse, but they're sacrifcing that to keep me - a fuckin' meatsack - alive. God I fuckin' hate that. 

As much as they're great, they're also the person that encouraged me to off myself. They were the one fuckin' person I opened up to, the one person I spilled my guts at and they threw these guts back at my face. I can't believe I trusted them, I'm a fool. The look on my damn face when I heard them say ""You can kill yourself, but not at my house"", the absolute fuckin' despair. I just lost it. I absolutely lost it. That was _not_ what I was expecting, nor did I ever want to hear that response from them.

They were just using me as a future leverage, the most cynical side of me thinks ""they're using me as a pawn"". In all my pessimism, I think to myself that once they get old, they'll berate me for not ""returning the favor"" and not taking care of them - which is absolutely bullshit. I am not indebted to them, I didn't ask them to take care of me, they did that in their own accord. And even if someone asked them to do it, why am I to blame? Why do I take the fall for that? To them I say screw off. 

And oh, the argument can be made ""so cut this family member off"" - I can't. Or the argument that ""open up to those who care"" - I don't know if they're being genuine. Thing is, when I spilled my guts to _them_, they told my mother and an aunt of mine - which prompted my mother and my aunt to constantly ask me about my status, so much to the point where it came annoying and I had to block them from everything in my life. If I hadn't spilled my guts to that particular person that I despise, my mother and my aunt would never know that I've wanted to off myself. And now that's on their conscience, great - wonderful! Absolutely fan-fuckin'-tastic.

I don't fuckin' know. I just don't know. I'm not dyin' because of that one person, I'm not dying because of some family shit, I couldn't give a damn if they cried or laughed at my death. I'm just tired, I'm so, _so_ tired. Every day I keep thinkin' when I'm going to off myself for good. Been thinkin' of _why_ I want to die for a while now and I still don't know - maybe my philosophy? 

I just, don't know anything do I? I'm taking a breather.

To anyone reading, apologies if this was a lot. I'm just exhausted, hopefully you have a good day. If you have some advice I'd appreciate it but don't ever feel like you need to comment - I don't expect strangers from the internet to be armchair therapists."
128,Do you guys/girls think I have a chance?,"There's this girl I'm kind of interested in now. I'll tell some stuff about her, then about me. You guys/girls let me know if you think I have a chance. I'm genuinely not sure (leaning towards no though) so I need some others' opinions on it.

About her: Short, extremely hot (one of the hottest girls in my school imo), cheerleader, a bit shy, smart, fairly quiet, nice, willing to get to know me (so she says) at least as a friend. Fairly certain she doesn't have a boyfriend but she likely has had one before.

To be honest I don't know much more than this about her, I'm in the process of getting to know her.

About me: Also short (shorter than her), been called cute by several girls (none of which wanted to date me though), nerd (in a good way), very shy, smart, quiet, kind, never had a girlfriend before or even held hands with a girl.

Honestly I think I don't really have much of a chance but I'd like some other opinions on it."

130,These death posts are just stupid,"There is literally no reason to post about deaths on a teenager subreddit. Most people here are hormonal horror shows and obviously aren't emotionally developed to comprehend situations like that. It's just gonna make them uncomfortable or awkward or just guilt them in to giving you fake internet points. Which is obviously just so god damn fucked up. 

Some people have their own shit to deal with and don't wanna see depressing shit on a light hearted sub with the intentions of communicating with other people you have things in common with. It's so unnecessary and fucked up to even put teens in a situation like that. And what are you gonna gain from it? Fake internet points and a bunch of people, who stress over things as little as talking to the opposite gender or doing homework, feeling sorry for you? Feeling guilty for not giving you a meaningless arrow? 

This is just not the place to post about those sort of things, whether it's some obviously bullshit story, or something sincere, teenagers aren't gonna be able to feel comfortable with it. So please, with the utmost respect, just don't fucking post it. Vent to someone properly who is comfortable with it, don't just throw it in people's faces and use a tragic event for fake internet points. Real or fake

So mods, please just do everyone a favor and ban just unnecessary, sensitive, posts"

135,"I did it boys, I cut ties with a toxic girl","So there’s this chick who’s has me on a string for months and I’ve basically been there for her whenever she needed me but I always felt like it was one sided but it took me a while to realize how toxic she was being

Here’s some context from recent that’s driven me to this conclusion. I went on vacation to Florida last week for thanksgiving and she suddenly got super flirty and even got jealous because I was gonna do the deed with a girl I met at my hotel, we talked all week and we eventually agreed that when I got back we should hang and also do it maybe which is pretty cash money I love hanging out with her.

But when I got back she barely acknowledged my existence and when I asked to hang out to go see a movie or whatever, she gave some bullshit lie that her parents wouldn’t let her go because of “freezing rain” there wasn’t any happening, and the forecast didn’t say anything about so I said, uh ok. I asked to FaceTime, nope she said “I can’t” but like she’s in her room? (we where Snapchatting)  and like today she straight up ignored me all day and left me on read for over 30 hours, out of nowhere

I’ve been at my wits end for a hot minute but like now it’s done, I’ve gushed over her since September and now this is how I’m being treated? Like nothing? Yea no thanks bye.

I tried to say maybe it was a woman who had her period(who knows???)

141,I’m Sorry Thomas Edison,"I don’t remember how many years ago this was, but one time, I was home sick from school, and I had my light on. I eventually turned it off, and the light bulb was really hot. For some reason, I wanted to see if I could cool it down, so I got a spray bottle and started spraying the light bulb. I was probably just standing there, happy as can be, when all of a sudden, the light bulb just exploded. I didn’t get hurt, because the light bulb pieces didn’t come towards me, but thinking about it now, that could’ve been very bad. I don’t think my mom found out for a while, and for some reason, I didn’t just replace the light bulb before she did."

147,"depression, suicide and making my mom cry.","I just made my mom cry. She thinks that i’m trying to push her away from my life, i just turned into a teenager recently so that’s pretty ironic. The truth is i’m depressed. I have life to blame on that, i don’t hate myself, i just wish that i were better and treated better. I’m privileged enough to have a nice house, a computer, and all that junk, but the way i’m treated (especially in school) just makes me ask god, “why me?”. Most friends i’ve had use me as a punching bag of the group, and i’m too weak to tell them to stop. If i did push my “friends” away, i wouldn’t have any friends. I’m so desperate to not be alone that i let them keep bullying me, harassing me, emotionally abusing me etc. just so i have people to talk to at lunch. I think i deserve better. Maybe in a previous life i hurt someone really bad and felt no remorse from it. I’ve dealt with suicide before. One time in dinner, i was thinking “i should just grab the rope right now” or “run and stab myself with a kitchen knife.”

I deserve better. I’m really not asking for much. I just want to be treated with a bit more respect. My friends always chose them and exclude me specifically in group activities. It makes me want to bang my head into the wall until i see nothing but darkness, or kill my quote on quote “friends”.

Either there is no god, or he’s just playing with my life.

My mom crying does not make my suicidal thoughts &amp; depression any better. It makes me feel worthless and better off dead. I’m too much of a pussy to end it all. 

I think i do a good job of holding in my depression. No one goes up to me and asks if i’m alright, or maybe i’m not important enough to them.
I remember a time when i shattered and unleashed all my feelings to my sister. I told her about my anxiety, depression and suicidal thoughts. I was crying so hard that it was hard for me to breathe. She then tried to comfort me and say “it’s okay.” i tried my best to act like it really helped. It really didn’t. She definitely forgot about it now, but i’m still suicidal.

People would say that it’s normal for a teenager to feel these things, i’ve been feeling like this since i was 11. If i were to kill myself, sure, my grandparents, my mom, and my sister might cry, my friends would probably be over my death in like 3 days (i don’t really matter to my friends). BUT I’M SO ANTI-SOCIAL THAT I NEVER INTERACT WITH PEOPLE THAT I WOULD’VE GOTTEN TO KNOW THAT WOULD BE SAD ABOUT MY FUCKING DEATH.

I’m sorry, God. For everything. The lies i’ve told, the swears i’ve sworn, the promises i couldn’t keep, the feelings i’ve hurt, the people i’ve manipulated. I’m sorry. I’m sorry i couldn’t been better. I’ve been trying to pray every night now, but it just feels like you’re not listening, you know? Or maybe you’re just a myth. I’m sorry for thinking that.

People rarely listen to my opinions. When they do, it’s such a shock to me that i panic and feel like my opinions will bore them and i just try to end it quickly. I’m so self-conscious because of the people who… It doesn’t matter. Thank you for reading this, whoever cared enough to listen.



edit: i guess i didn't really explain how i made her cry. she went inside my room when it was locked at night and she's done this a few times recently, and i just now confronted her about it. she said ""AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING UNDER MY ROOF"" bla bla bla. I didn't think that was respecting my privacy but then she said stuff like that doesn't matter and started acting like an immature brat. she raised her voice for a bit then i just didn't want to hear her repeat herself anymore. i ended the conversation and just started preparing some food. she was looking at me the whole time and i'm insecure about my eating process and hate when people stare at me so i kept repeating ""ma!"" like 10 times. she then looked away. a few seconds later she was looking again. i then said ""why are you just staring at me?"". whilst eating, i heard her start crying."

155,Depression is like being hit by a spoon repeatedly.,"Like in that popular youtube video years ago called the “horribly slow murderer with the extremely inefficient weapon”. It kinda feels like that too. 

It’s so ridiculous! But it’s painful and you try to tell people but they don’t care as much cause it seems so trivial to them. 

You wish you would just get stabbed by a knife or get shot with a gun but instead you have to endure a slow and painful ordeal that you know and feel is killing you incrementally each day but that is also so silly to put into context that you don’t even know whether to laugh or cry about it sometimes."

I’m lonely. I’m deathly lonely. My dog used to keep me here, but I feel like she’s getting farther away from me too. I’m losing my mind. Well, I probably didn’t have it to begin with... I tell my mom that I’m feeling depressed, but neither of us can really do anything about it or use that information in a useful way. It’s more like “I feel depressed” “okay”. Not like she can wave a magic wand and fix it for me.

I love someone who would never love me. I’m stupid. Irrational. So many things. 

I don’t think I’m worthy of being alive anymore."
165,the socal experience a memoir,"it’s lunchtime and you have decided on a place to eat, the reviews were good and you walk up to the store pulling open the door you are greeted with a small panera style restaurant decorated with edison lightbulbs hanging over each wooden table with metal ikea chairs. there is a large metal sign with lights screwed into it that says “eat”

the color scheme is simple. black and white with pops of red and natural wood. you walk to the counter to place your order 

a white man with a brown haired man bun and pride pins stuck to his apron greets you with a smile and directs you to the menu which is cleverly written on a large chalkboard next to the counter. you browse the menu disappointed as the words vegan, gluten free, and soy appear. you notice the edgy name of one item the “f*ck it wrap” and stare confused for a minute. you then decide to just have the burger. 

you ask if it comes with fries, the man behind the counter looks at you disgusted and says “we  do not serve fries and we don’t fry anything here but we do have chips” disappointed you nod and say chips are ok and also get a coke with your meal. he offers you guacamole on your burger for only $2.50 more, you decline. he nods and says your total, “$37” 

you stand shocked about the price but not wanting to complain to this man you accept it and hand over your money. for some reason you grow uneasy as he hands you a mason jar for your coke and directs you to the chips stand to grab a bag. 

you browse the chips but find that there are not any kinds other than kettle cooked, you sigh grabbing the cape cod classic sea salt potato chips and fill your mason jar as well. 

you turn to find a table setting your things down and pulling out the metal ikea chair it makes a very loud scraping noise against the wooden floor. you begin sweating the loud noise has made you nervous and self conscious as you slide into the cold metal chair and SCRAPE it back towards the table you nervously open your kettle cooked chips and begin stress eating. feeling the judgement from the man with the man bun. 

you look some more at the decoration noticing license plates and more edison bulbs than before. a sign that brags about no wifi and encouraging you to talk to others with another next to it saying to like them on facebook and follow them on instagram. 

you sip from your mason jar preferring a straw you turn to look at man-bun man debating whether to even to even ask for such a thing beforing deciding better and turning away. 

at last your food comes out. you stare at the burger wrapped in a brown paper bag material it is small and vegan and absolutely no grease to be seen. you take a bite and immediately start to drink your coke for how dry the burger is. how can you fuck up a burger there is absolutely no flavor. should have gotten that damned guacamole. 

internally you are screaming from anxiety for not liking the food YOU SHOULD BE ENJOYING THE FOOD. you stare at the edison lightbulbs dangling above your head as you eat. gulping your coke you are shaking as you finish the dry ass burger and you get up the chair scraping once again with the loudest noise you’ve ever heard your brow is sweating you quickly drop off your mason jar and tray off before finally leaving that god forsaken hippie store. 

you are at peace again. and still hungry"

I’m a nice guy I’ve been told I’ve also been told “I’m cute” which is rare but it happened before so now it’s a core part of me, I have a pretty low self esteem and care way to much about what people think of me

I always feel like I look like shit even when people say I’m not bad looking and even though I’m athletic still don’t like how I look

I’m really chill and don’t normally have a high energy and when I do it’s probably because I’m comfortablewith the people around me because if I’m not I won’t be there due to my crippling social anxiety at times

Anyway if I sound cool please dm me"

 I’m a sophomore in highschool and this kid that used to go to my highschool (transferred after sophomore year, would’ve been a junior) died yesterday due to a car crash. His younger sister still goes to my school and I have a class with her. The kid that died was someone that I knew but never had a conversation with. I remember him Freshman year and thinking he was kinda annoying and kind of poking fun at him with a couple of friends but now I don’t know how to feel. He crashed at about 8:00 AM and had just dropped off his younger sister at school and was driving to his. Even though I never knew him and kind of poked fun at him I’m really sad. I keep on thinking about his parents and sister and how every day his sister will have to come home to an empty house. I have a sister and I know if I lost her I would break. So, I just wanted to kind of let my feelings out and just say sorry and that I will pray for your family and there well being and that I hope I can go to your funeral and pay my respects"

As I got older and learned and visited places of other religions it seemed weird to me that if there was a god that he would be ok with all the other religions cause one of the comandments is only to worship him. I also grew up thinking people who drink coffee or alcahol or do drugs are monsters and none of it seems right to me. I also learned a lot in school how every religion has just as much evidence to say its real but its just what you believe in. So I'm atheist now and don't go to,church but my parents don't go either they are just inactive but still belive and they think I still believe and I feel guilty about it.

204,Ugly person perspective - Are attractive people ever depressed?,"If I were a god I would be the god of ugliness, or at the very least the avatar of the god of ugliness. I can barely stand to look at myself in a mirror because my face is so disturbing it makes me sick. My eyes are too close together, my head is skinny and long yet somehow fat and round, my ears are asymmetrical, my hair cannot be fashioned into anything good, and my body is the worst shape that could ever be imagined. I am only 65 kgs yet due to my shortness I have random limb sizes.

I think if I looked attractive I would feel a lot better about myself and my inability to talk to people would be offset by the fact people would be more likely to talk to me because they like how I look. I have never once had anyone compliment me and I can't blame them. My mind may be screwed but I could of at least had a good body. 

I find it hard to think of anyone who is attractive that suffers from depression, or at the very least lets depression rule their lives. Physical attraction is very important in society and without anything to attract people you fall by the wayside and die alone. I find it hard to believe that I rolled the dice at birth and got a 1 for mental health and a 1 for physical characteristics, but it happened. Now where is that 80z pony sized bottle so I can forget this horrid existence for a while.

205,"I need to save myself. I'm a 19 year old college student with social anxiety, depression, and an addiction to staying home and playing video games.","I'm desperate here. I feel I'm a fairly intelligent guy, however, due to my decision to start playing video games as a kid, I shut myself in. 

I have minimal real life experience with social interaction, and I only had  a small group of friends in high school. Now in college, I'm a loner, and it feels bad. However, it is so easy to stay home and browse the internet / play games.

Sometimes I see people in my life who I can tell are outgoing and happy with their lives, but in no way do they reflect the person that I have become. 

I am wondering if true change in a person is only found in extreme cases. Am I just turning out to be that shut-in recluse? Is that just my role in society? My entire life - it feels like - has been filled with a tough time fitting in, neglecting responsibilities, and pushing people away.

I don't know how to be outgoing, and there are few places I feel like I could go to in my city alone without being a creep. Help me get started please?"
206,I'm angry at my brother for dying before me.,"First off, I love my brother. He was always so tall and strong when I was a kid and I remember wishing I was just like him. He came back into our lives for about a year after disappearing, and it was fun for a while. Eventually he moved away. Not long after, he was shot and killed.

After that, I had to beg my girlfriend for emotional support. After a while we broke up and she wrongly accused me of cheating, resulting in me losing every friend I had, including my best friend who had previously kept me from attempting again for so long.

That was two years ago. My depression hasn't stopped since I was seven, but none of these things made it any better. And it isn't better for my family either. I have wanted to attempt again for the last two years but my mom can't lose another son. My sister can't lose another brother. I want to destroy myself, but I don't want to destroy the last people who support me.

I can't kill myself because my brother has blocked that road for me. My family members aren't immune to depression and where it can take them. I believe I have the right to die, but what am I supposed to do? I can't leave this world and it's all his fault."

222,I'm a monster who will never get better.,"I had a very stressful time at work last night/this morning (i work nights) and unfortunately snapped at my fiance. we proceeded to argue for over two hours. we both got extremely hysterical, apologized, and talked a little bit more until my sleeping pills kicked in and i had to go because i have work again tonight. i thought everything was okay.  
but then two hours after i went to sleep they sent me a text that said we're over, that they don't care if they ever hear from me again. I know they have been online within the last couple of hours but true to their word they're not speaking to me...  
Now my mental state probably needs way more context. I have borderline personality disorder and I was on my way into going into ""remission"" in 2015. Then my mom was diagnosed with late-stage lung cancer and wasted away in less than 9 months. We had found out her illness progressed to stage 4 right before she died. She died when I was en route to the hospital, and I never got to say goodbye. I got wasted at a friend's house after her service and he raped me. My fiance was jealous of this friend (before the rape) and our relationship has been in the shitter since that happened. Aaaand then my house burned down and I live in pretty serious poverty all the while my fiance won't move in or even come see me anymore (we live quite a ways apart and their family also hates me and interferes with us a lot).  
As an aside, I know all of this sounds fake and dramatic but I have proof of at least my mother's death and the fire idk  
I snap at my fiance a lot, I'm angry all the time, and now they've abandoned me because I'm a monster. I've never been more fucking ashamed of myself or my illness. I have too much to sort through and I'll never be okay.  
A huge part of me right now wants to skip going to work and either kill myself or go to the hospital instead. I have a few methods in mind, a couple would take some planning and would only happen if I still feel suicidal next month. I've lost pretty much everything that was anchoring me to this world and I'm ready to go.  
EDIT: I've just remembered that if I go to the hospital I will get a bill for at least $1,000 when I am already in medical debt and that just makes me feel more suicidal."
223,I am the biggest hypocrite on Reddit,"Every time there's a post on here about someone's crush I'm just like ""shoot your fucking shot man, worst that'll happen is things become a bit awkward between you"".

226,"Want to self-harm, I think...","
TL,DR version:
I frequently think of physically hurting myself. But I am NOT suicidal. And I haven't done something drastic till now. 
Do I have to seek any solution for this.? If so, what do you suggest I do?
____________________

I've never actually been suicidal. Never have I wanted to actually die before...
But lately I've been outright ""fantasising"" about  kinda hurting myself...

I want to swallow a bunch of my sleeping pills and end up unconscious or atleast hung over (I KNOW these pills are not lethal).
Or get something sharp and slash my forearm or leg and see the blood and feel the pain (but not cut a vessel and haemorhage to death)
Or simply go hit my head or fist or something repeatedly against a wall till its painful and maybe starts to bleed
Once even thought of hanging by neck from somewhere (dismissed it immediately)
And along with these fantasies, i also fantasise that people around me might notice  my predicament and will be nice to me.

These thoughts don't actually feel unwanted or wrong to me. It could even be said that I ""indulge"" in there imaginations...
But I would never express these to someone else IRL. 
Either they'll label me a crazy attention seeker - which will make sure they'll never trust me and start hating me.
Or if they simply try to help somehow - I'll only end up as a burden to them. 
Worst of all they could confirm the truth that I deserve to be punished - that everyone does truly hate me and I'M wrong to think they shouldnt.
(I guess another option is they'll hand me off a medical professional... Unfortunately, thats not a good thing either in my situation*)

Its like I feel I deserve to be punished; and if I am approriately punished, others will stop hating me.
Also self-harm will prove to people I'm not a useless coward and that I make my own decisions. And maybe those who mean to bully me will call off since they don't want to risk any ""crazy/psycho"" retaliation. 
A part of me even thinks it'll prove to me that I too can be edgy and interesting - like how getting black out drunk or other risky behavious are ""celebrated""at times... I'm tired of being so bland and passive...

Anyway,  I dont think I'm decisive, proactive and/or brave enough to ever actually go through with any of these ""fantasies"". So they're unlikely to actually cause any permanent damage to me.

Should I do something about this problem? 
(Again,  a reminder - I am not looking to kill myself now.. )


* I'm a health professional working in a multi speciality hospital. If something drastic happens or I actively seek treatment,  I'lL end up at my own workplace for and all my colleagues will know me aS a crazy attention seeking bItch. Everyone will know me my weakness - ~I'll become the target for more bullying.  Some might pity me,  but I'll never have any real friends.  So I can't approach professional help easily... 

EDIT: corrected spelling and grammar mistakes and elaborated the (*).
EDIT: removed the part where I mention the exact drug and dosage I took to help sleep. That's not appropriate information to be shared publicly like this."

Shut up

This goes out to all our extroverts here. I'm fairly sure I speak for most introverts when i say we like talking to our friends and MAYBE some strangers that we share similar interests with, but if your a stranger that one day decided to talk at us for a good while, I feel like we could tolerate it for a good couple minutes but after that all we are thinking about is how badly we want you to leave us alone. So if you *really* want to befriend the introvert kid, dont be so up close and personal. Take it slow.

Not even my house (on my father name) doesn't cost this much and my salary is 410 dollars.

I can't let my family pay for my mistakes.I know that my brother will be destroyed when he finds out I killed myself,but there is no other option.The last six years of my life are filled with regrets.I am a self hating monster.You can check my posts history to see what I really am.I am not killing myself,I am just taking out the trash.Tomorrow at this time I will hang myself .I tried to kill myself a few weeks ago ,but my ex girlfriend and a cousin scraped my plans.They only delayed them.It needs to end by tomorrow.I am sorry...

**UPDATE:** Today,Wednesday,November 29,2017 I wanted to kill myself.As I put everything in order and prepared to hang myself at an abandoned factory I saw my brother .He was supposed to come in weekend ,like every week.I found that he was too fired from work (we worked at the same place,he was working only on weekends part time).So when he learned that we are now both jobless he accepted the news and was a bit upset.I was so fucking relieved.I thought I disappointed him that I had no use for anyone.My emotions are numbed,I feel pretty apathetic,but I am not suicidal anymore,at least for a time...

My dad hates my friends so i dont really get to hang out with them bit they are the ONLY people in my life who i can talk to and feel comfortable. We hang out, i crack jokes and shit but thats the only joy i get in life and my dads stripped that away. My stepmom ALWAYS wants us to clean and says ""if you cleaned yesterday we could be relaxing today"" when she knows well as i do that we busted our asses cleaning yesterday. Not to mention she and my dad and my step siblings are super christian and im definitely not. Their lives revolve around God like planets and a sun meanwhile i want them to just pay attention to ME for a second. Sound selfish but they never talk to me. I got a boyfriend and Karen said ""if he breaks up with you dont come crying, its gonna happen you two arent destined for life you arent getting married.""

Im sorry, WHAT!? Yeah i get we arent gonna be together forever. Thats cool and all. But this bitch told me im not allowed to C R Y. Sorry, i forgot that im supposed to be a soulless puppet of yours who does whatever you want when you want it. Also, im only allowed in my room to sleep. No other reason is acceptible. Of course i sneak time up there as often as possible but i doesnt last long. I just want to hide in my room and cry. I want to just lay there and cry out everything but im not allowed too. Instead every waking hour is spent at school and doing whatever she wants when all i want to do is crawl under my bed and die alone. Also, heres something she told me. I dont remember it word for word but its close enough i think: ""We love you and care about you, but the house is really peaceful when your visiting your mom over the holidays. No fights or anything. But when your here its all loud and stuff. But we still love you!"" Damn, what a dick move. You love me but you like it better when im gone, makes sense.

When i come back from visiting other family (I go by myself to my grandparents for the summer) theyre all snuggling up and all buddy buddy with me and im the same way back, but after a month and a half it just crumbles. Everyones back to leaving me in the dust. All i want is to hug someone. I want someone to tell me its going to be alright because when i vent to my brother he laughs. When i vent to my sister she nods a few times and tries to act sympathetic. I cant tell my parents because im afraid of them. I get that there my parents, not my friends but i dont think we should be enemy's, either. I dont want to flinch when Karen comes to close because she gets mad at me when i cant help it because im really scared of her and its my reflexes. I want her to love me. I want to love her. I want us to have a healthy mother-daughter relationship. I want to go out for icecream with her and do whatever the hell it is mothers and daughters do because i dont even know what they do because i've never had that experience. Im so hungry for attention that at school (even though im in 8th grade) i make weird noises and shout random shit in the middle of classes and tests just because i want people to notice me. They all hate me because all i do is cause disruption because i am SUCH an attention whore. I just want to die. I never wanted to live, so why the FUCK am i here right now? Why was i born, my dad has straight up said i was cause by his irresponsibility. Dad, why couldn't you and mom be more responsible? I dont want to be here. I dont want to exist. The world can work without me so just give me the receipt so i can get a refund. I want to return my existence.

Sorry for the rant but thanks for reading anyways i appreciate it.

EDIT: Forgot to mention this but the reason im afraid of my stepmom is because she hits me when i openly disagree with her. (Which is often because she's really homophobic and transphobic but im bi so it doesnt mix well. Im the type to stand up for myself, i dont like people to tell me how i feel. My parents say thats what gets me in trouble, is my opinions.

Tldr: bad parents, bad school, i want to fucking die in a hole."
282,I just wanted someone to love,"And to be loved but that's too much to ask, obviously. I'm out. I'm tired of being nothing but a conquest and I'm not fucking doing it anymore. Can't get hurt if you're dead (temple tap meme)

If my family finds this, it wasn't your fault. I'm done feeling hopeful just to get hurt and I'm MUCH better off this way. I've finally reached my breaking point and I'm more afraid to live than I am to die. At least nobody will use me anymore and I can finally get some sleep.

Better luck and love to all of you, don't be like me. Be better. I imagine anything is better than this bullshit I have to feel everyday. It's time to let go. I never learned my lesson until now. Nobody will ever really want me for anything but fucking no matter what. I'm not a love, I'm a disposable plaything. I was, anyway. I'm outie 5000 ✌"

Every relationship I've been in has ended because the guy didnt want me. I'm no good for anyone. My son could go to his dad.  I'm in the bath right now with booze and a knife just praying for the courage to press down on my wrist and whip it across.

289,I hate needing love,"I can’t get it anywhere so why do I want it so much? Like genuine love. I hate the human need for love, affection, attention because what are you supposed to do when it’s not available? Where’s the biological failsafe for that? I’m left hurting and alone every single day."

291,I finally learned to be proud of myself and what I do after years of despondence. I genuinely love myself :),"I just wanted to say that after a long while of feeling ashamed of myself, not good enough, untalented, unskilled, that came from a lack of self love, after learning how to love myself (which was NOT an easy task, it took months straight of inner work and reflection and letting go of friendships to make that happen), but when I did, I realized I really am a cool person. :) I'm accomplished in different kinds of art, writing, and now that I started piano and learning how to make my own music a couple of months ago, I learned that for a beginner I'm pretty good at playing with both of my hands at the same time. I expected to struggle more with making my left hand cooperate but I'm really pleasantly surprised that I'm not doing as badly as I thought I would. I feel like even though I'm not a master at anything I do, i have always put in the work to be good at what I want to do, and it has always paid off. I have a knack for learning language and have been doing physical pursuits like learning how to do handstands and cartwheels and backbends and kickovers. Failure doesn't devastate me anymore. I know what school I want to go to and what career I'm set on currently. I feel so accomplished. I'm just really proud of myself and haven't sat down to fully appreciate and acknowledge that I deserve to feel proud of myself and the things I do. :)

I'm at such a good place in life content with myself and I genuinely feel like even when I have rough patches, things for me will just continue to get better. Somehow I gained an innate optimism."

301,"I'm not that sad, sometimes even slightly happy but mostly just in a flat mood. I don't feel like doing anything other than sleeping time away, not even playing games which I used to love and everything gets so boring after just a couple minutes.","Have been like this for quite a while, on a whole bunch of different medications and things aren't really improving beyond the current state. I don't feel that bad in day to day life but can't do anything meaningful either, with occasional bouts of depressive thoughts when I think about myself, my life and maybe my future. I wonder if it's the illness or just me being an lazy ass. Anyone else in the same state? Wondering if I'm still ""qualifying"" as genuinely depressed."
302,thoughts of ending it reoccurring from time to time,"I wanted to write a big long text, but since I am in this subreddit, i think no point of telling you how i feel , you know how i feel.

I am being single, lonely, miserable, depressed, sad for over 10 years.
Im way in my 30s now.

Everything i have tried, its not helping. And i have tried everything.
I just feel lonely and depressed all the time. Second by second.

I usually tell myself something like ""ok, lets give it a year, i will do this and that, if it doesn't help, i will end it"".

The year passes by, nothing has changed...but i somehow get it together and say, ok..""lets try this and that, since i still didnt"" and , give it a shot for 6 months.

Well, as you may guess...the time is passing by...i am more lonely and depressed as im getting older.

The standard things like everyone is being married and having kids doesn't help. 

I just dont know what to do anymore.
I see no happiness in anything. I have little extra money, so i can afford things...but, they are just things, and they don't make me happy at all.

I just dont see a way out of it, and im not sure what is the point of telling myself...it will get better in 6 months, a year, 5 years.

Its been over 10 years and is has only been pain and suffering through those years. 

I know it sucks, but, I see no reason to live anymore. For who? For me?
The pain i will feel when I end it will be far less then all the pain I am feeling on daily basis.

It's just too much.

Is there any magic/special thing I should do or try, like a hail mary move. Try it and see if it helps....

I have tried EVERYTHING. 

Well, except being in a relationship, cause of course I cannot find anyone. 

Thank you for reading."

307,Dad said I’ll probably be fired from being an incompetent worker,I suffer from pretty severe anxiety and depression from my bipolar and between starting new meds and just the regular stressers of trying to live a relatively healthy life it’s just something I didn’t need to hear. Not after working an over 10 hour shift at the first job I’ve ever had. I’ve been there 7 months and was just talking with my dad about maybe looking for a new job with in the next few months cuz management has changed and he said “why wait you’ll probably be fired cuz you don’t know how to act right” now I’ve heard worse from others and even from him usually comments don’t hit me so hard.

314,Talking about the hate for religion on this subreddit,"The majority of reddit is atheists. That is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong with that. Unfortunetly there are also quite a few anti theists. You dont have to support religion but there is no reason for someone to go out of their way to hate on a person for being religious. And some atheists will go put saying ""yeah but anti atheists are worse"". But I don't think that excuses talking about how religious people are dumb. Even if you don't support religious people you should still respect them. And I know a some religious people are bigoted but I'm upset about the atheists who complain about religious people in general or go to religious subreddits to bully the users. It's completely pointless. (Also I'm aware many theists bully atheists as well, this isn't trying to compare the two. I just see a lot of anti theist on this subreddit, so please don't bring up that atheists get bullied too, I know they do)."
315,I did an oopsie today,"So me and my family were out getting food at a restaurant before going to watch Toy Story 4, and i accidentally sat down at the wrong table after getting stuff from the salad bar.

A waitress comes over and then, all of a sudden, *I realize.*

We sort of causally realize and I go over to my family's table.

Have fun laughing at me."
316,I didn't get out of bed till 4pm today,"I know I'm probably depressed. I know I should call my school's counseling center. But is it worth it?

I haven't gotten out of bed today because the thought of getting ready and leaving my apartment to study for the classes I'm probably going to fail is too much. I have way too much to do and not enough time because it takes me a long time to learn the material. I've become so apathetic that I'm not even going to one of my colleges biggest football games today because I told myself I would waste too much studying time (never mind the fact that I've done nothing today) and I don't really want to have to see my ""friends"" and all their happy lives. I'm exhausted, not only from school, but also from the constant fear and worry that I'm going to fail my classes and that the next 2.5 years of my major will be too hard.

My stupid tiny room in my stupid tiny apartment is right next to the living room/kitchen and I can hear one of my roommates outside so I can't even go outside to try to do something today because I don't want her to see that its 4 o'clock and I'm still in my pajamas, haven't brushed my teeth, and haven't eaten anything today. I just can't deal with anyone right now. I can't even deal with myself right now.
I don't have anything. I'm not even good at anything. I have nothing. I want somebody to care about me and ask ME how I'm doing for once. I want my friend to text me back. I want to tell the guy I like how I feel without it ruining our friendship. I want a hug. I want someone that I can lean on but I don't have anyone. So I'm going to stay in bed today and try tomorrow.

THe scariest thing is that a week ago I was walking to the library at night, feeeling stressed and worried and miserable, and I thought ""what if I just stayed outside all night?"" It's getting colder at night now, so I probably would be dead in the morning. I hate the person I've become but maybe I didn't become anything, and it was me all along. I want to be better but I don't think I'm cut out for it at all. How am I supposed to be an engineer if I can barely handle 4 classes when I should be taking 5 plus research plus clubs plus being a sane person? I can't do it but I don't know what else to do with my life, so I'm going to stay in bed and hide from the world."
317,Raising awareness during suicide awareness month,"I am making this post to let those of you who struggle with suicidal thoughts know you aren't alone. 

In the US, it's estimated that half of teens have at least one mental health condition. We need to work on raising awareness to let those who are suffering know they aren't alone. The statistics show they aren't alone, with nearly 20% of high school students reporting they've experienced serious suicidal thoughts, and around 9% making at least one attempt to end their lives.

If you're wondering why I care, I am a part of that 20% of high school students who have had suicidal thoughts. It can be shameful to admit, and I often feel selfish or guilty for having these thoughts. It isn't pretty, but it's the reality for myself and many others. If me being open about my struggles can make even one teenager feel less alone in suffering, that's a win for me.

I was always too scared to attempt, but I had a friend in middle school who struggled with that and I'm thankful they are still here today. You never know who is struggling until you get to know them. 

To raise awareness, I've created a form where you as a community can submit your favorite reasons to live, you can also put your reddit username in your submission to get credit. I plan on compiling your reasons to live along with some of my own in a google doc that can be shared with struggling people, along with making a list of redditors who are open to talk with those struggling people and other resources those individuals can use. You can choose to be added to that list, but it's not a requirement when submitting the form. 

If you know anyone who is struggling, I thank you personally for sticking with them and being there for them while they are struggling. Even if it doesn't seem like, those positive individuals who are there to listen make the biggest difference and can even save someone's life.

I have started to harm myself, just for the feeling of having a feeling. I lost my house 3 weeks ago in a fire that almost killed me and 2 friends. Since, the friends (one the love of my life) have completely changed and are phasing away from me. I just found out my uncle was shot 8 times and killed. My first cat (had her for 14 years) had to be put down 3 days ago. My best friend thinks I'm to dangerous to be around, although I am not violent.

The string holds the ink so you don’t have to redip after each poke.

I’m concerned for him because I think he will regret doing this later in life, when he has a crappy smiley face on his wrist and it turns out that he can’t get rid of it without expensive laser surgery. Are these things permanent, like real tattoos? What should I tell him to express my fears and concerns?"

359,My problem with parents/adults...,"There’s a lot to say about this but I gonna try to keep it short but, why do they act as if they know everything about everything even when they don’t? And when you say something right your actual wrong simply because “they know best”. Why do they treat us as if we’re homeless people who begged them to stay here? as if they didn’t willingly have us, and because of this we don’t have a say in anything because “we don’t pay any bills”. Why do they fail to realize times are different from when they were kids? For example a lot of stuff you can learn in school you can learn on the internet for free and that college isn’t the only way to be successful now, there are people who are rich off of video games but they say those people are no lives and need school, but isn’t that what it’s ultimately for? Getting a good education so you can get a job and live comfortable but Boring and average life. Why do they say our opinions aren’t valid? Why do they think we don’t need privacy? Why aren’t we allowed to be depressed and sad? Why do they expect us to to every single thing that say no matter what it is or what we think of it at the drop of a dime? One time I was on the tv but stopped so I could take the trash out and when I come back my dad was on it and I said I was on it very respectfully and he responds “excuse me” and says a whole bunch of extra stuff. And even after doing all of that they wonder why we’re always in our rooms, and don’t want to talk to them about anything or tell them our feelings. Ultimately it almost feels as if we’re not truly valid and human until we’re 18, out the house, have a car, pay bills, have a good education, and work at a dead end job. we’re people too..."

363,Advice on 'reaching out to someone'.,"Hi everyone, firstly, let me say that you are a very awesome and compassionate community and I admire your inclusive and caring mentality; you guys rule!  
  
I'd just like to hand out some friendly advice for those of you who generously take the time to help others who're in trouble on this subreddit. Naturally, there are a lot of self posts and comments here writen by people who could use someone to talk to, and may or not be looking for someone, even a stranger, to help them out. And it's great that redditors here often reply with a message or comment, reaching out to whoever's in trouble.  
  
However, that first message/comment often takes this form:  
  
""_Hi, I read your post in r/whatever and thought you could use a friend, just wanted to let you know you can PM me anytime! \*Hugs\*_""  
  
In my opinion and experience, this is not the way to go about reaching out to someone. Note: for convenience, I will differentiate between the receiver and sender of the message using 1st/3rd person, ie: Suppose I'm the receiving party. I don't want this to make it seem like I'm being very demanding, in fact I'm not all that conerned by the things mentioned below when people message me. It's just that many others _are_. The tense convention is for clarity.  
  
OK. I honestly do understand, and am very flattered by, the sender's intentions. But much of the time, depending on how bad I'm feeling, the message might well have no effect at all on me; it might even have the opposite effect to what was intended. There are some problems here. Let me explain them. (I should point out that I am not suggesting that _all_ the offers of help people recieve here are like this; this is a worst-case scenario).
  
**1.** It is very short. This makes it seem as though the sender really wasn't that bothered, or doesn't have very much time to talk. This might make me think my own problems are not worth anyone's time, maybe not even worth _my_ time. But how to fill out the message? Well. See: 2.
  
**2.** It's a single, declarative statement, followed by an 'open offer' of communication. What this does is place the responsibility on me to respond to the sender. It's almost as though _I'm_ now the one who is expected to reach out; defeating the purpose of the message. In writing their message the sender should actively engage me; the best way of doing this is _asking questions_. Specifically, open questions that refer to what little they may already know about me, and questions that lead into further discussion. They should not ask incisively personal questions, but they should at least be of a more personal nature than as though we were two strangers on the street.  
  
**3.** The sender of the message does not say anything about themselves. This can sometimes make the interaction seem a bit like an anonymous call to a hotline (for example) for me. It's not easy to simply open up about all the things I may have spoken about that made them want to message me, and it is nice to have some other topic to perhaps broach first, maybe to see if we share some interests/experiences - things like that. In fact, if the sender is very generous with their time, they may even want to write the message just as they would to someone they simply want to make friends with! Not merely because this is a good way to start helping someone, but honestly because most people (redditors especially!) are worth getting to know! Although it's important not to distract from the point that the person who sent the message is reaching out; the message is ultimately all about an offer of help for me.
  
**4.** Might not seem important, but it ends with ""\*Hugs\*"". For me (speaking as myself here rather than the message receiver), there's nothing wrong with that, actually, I love it when people send me cute little _hugs_ messages! However, it's important to note that I might find it immature, or, on the other end of the spectrum, might find it too forward; perhaps I only use that term for people who I am very close to. Admittedly, these are two extremes, but it brings up the general point of #4: the sender should try to use a writing style that seems appropriate, from what they already know about me. This doesn't mean copying all my expressions and tone, but the sender should try to communicate with an appropriate level of formality/informality. Where this is not possible, they should adopt a neutral, but friendly, tone until they know me better.  
  
Keeping these 4 pitfalls in mind when reaching out to someone is worthwhile, I believe. I know we all have only the best intentions, but it can't hurt to be conscious of how best to go about helping each other :)  
  
Messages that do fall into these traps can often, as I said before, be ignored, or even make things worse. Often it's difficult for someone who reaches out to realise that they have gone wrong because of [this common reaction](http://imgur.com/tI66d).  
  
I think we are very lucky to have reddit/the internet as a nice middle ground between communicating with close, long-term IRL friends or family; and utterly anonymous hotline communication. We shouldn't let reddit turn into the latter :)  
  
Anyway that's my $0.02. Love you all and thanks for reading!"

366,"I have the most exciting and fun filled life, and I hate it.","People often tell me that they wish they wish they could be me because my life is ""like a movie"" and I'm always up to something fun and new. In reality I absolutely hate my life, and that's why I'm always out having fun, to forget about how much I hate myself. I should be happy with myself. I have a ton of friends that would do anything for me and I'm always out doing something, but I still feel empty and hopeless.

369,For those of you who watched salad fingers...,Should I watch it? I was watching some this is America 2 reactions and one of the videos mentioned salad fingers so I look it up and find that it’s something I already knew about and have been avoiding for years.

Some might be cringy but reddit has people like that too. tHE FORTNITE COMMUNITY  might be full of toxic 9 yr olds but some people actually enjoy the game"
371,Time is slipping through my fingers like grains of sand...,"For years now, death has been hanging in the back of my head.
When I was younger, my depression was worse and I felt I had nothing to live for. Truth be told, my life was terrible and I didn't, really. I was downright suicidal at times. 
But eventually, I turned my life around. I cut the toxic influences (like the woman formerly known as my mother) from my life. Even more important, I found someone who I love and who loves me, a man who I'm celebrating our tenth anniversary with next year and marrying :)
At the back of my head, though, is death. Until my teens, I was religious. These days, I don't have faith... But I have hope. Hope that there's something beyond death. That this isn't all there is.
A few years, taking a Psych class, it occurred to me again that's may be nothing. That there hasn't really been any scientific evidence of life after death, and the sciencey side of me has little other than doubt. Now, with a relatively happy life, the thought terrified me. For a while, it was sort of a crisis for me.
My fiance's after dying at 62 a few years ago and my own father's death last November at 53 didn't help. They were both sudden.
The thing is, I hope there's something else. I want to try to find at least some loose in-person evidence that there is, perhaps to reassure me. 
Because I tire of falling into these melancholy holes, where I feel that nothing I do matters - imagining everything disappearing in a pinpoint of light, like turning off an old television. Just no longer... Existing. 
Or, even worse, if something happened to my fiancé... Imagining him no longer existing anymore in any sense. 
I hope my father is sill out there, somewhere... Not just in my memory.
I guess I'm just looking for some sort of comfort here. I'm 30 years old and time seems to be slipping by way too fast, especially if the end is the end."

375,[relationship] advice on how to break up with a girl who still has lots of feelings for you?,"I just don't have the same feelings for her that I did going into the relationship. It makes me feel awful, because she has done nothing to make me fall out of love with her. I believe I've changed a lot as a person over this summer and my desire for a relationship is now little to none. I also have a lot on my plate right now as a 17 year old boy. I really need to make a good final push so I can get into a half decent college, and I'm training with my hockey team in preparation for another shot at a state title. On top of that, I have a job that demands a lot of my time. I also really want to try to enjoy myself in my senior year because the last couple of year have not been so great. I feel selfish just writing this, but its the truth and its not fair to her if I keep lying to her and telling her I love her. She has been so sweet and kind to me, and she's always telling me how I'm her world and how she loves me so much. I lost my virginity to this girl, but recently I can't even climax during sex because I'm not physically attracted to her anymore, which also makes me feel awful. So I really don't know how I could explain all that to her without absolutely crushing her heart. I dread having this conversation with her but I know that it has to happen. Is there anything I can do that would make it easier on her? "
376,Genuinely feel heartbroken that I had to leave my kitten for college,"I know this sounds stupid but I've been struggling for mild depression ever since 2019 began. Then all of a sudden my mom brings home a kitten that her co-worker had to give away. I don't know why, but the kitten specifically really liked me. I was in a really low point and she made me feel better. I remember when I was feeling hopeless and empty and close to suicide at one point and she came out of nowhere and laid down on my lap purring. She reminded me of what happiness felt like and maybe that life is worth it.

I really miss my kitten. I just feel alone. I have no friends and aren't close with my family. 

How do I get over this?"
377,"No one ever talks to me. To the select few, thank you.","Hey. I feel sad, lonely, depressed. I miss my friend... still.. I feel alone. It's thundering and this night sucks. I feel pretty damn worthless and I am 18 and achieved nothing in life. I am losing all of my friends because I am to much of a fuck up with to many fucking problems. I do have some people to talk to but I am to much of a burden. If anyone wants to talk to me send me a PM. I do have a kik and it would mean a lot if I had more people to talk to.

378,I am going to over the holiday break record a demo for me playing MKWII,"I’m excited because this is, for many, a quality game and I have multiple stories. Have a good day and I’ll see you if I decide to do it."
379,"Alright, its my turn.","Before I write about myself, I've been reading the posts here for a while. Most people who post here are just teenagers who got dumped or can't get a girlfriend. These are not good reason for suicide. That shit is temporary. In all likelihood you will get over it and have a nice life. Don't fuck it up by killing yourself... That said who am I to judge.

Now me. I have multiple serious health conditions. The first one is an autoimmune spinal disease thats slowly eating away the cartilage between my vertebrae. my back hurts every day of my life. Its hard to walk. Its hard to stand. Its hard to sit. It sucks. My second health condition is an aggressive polyneuropathy that my doctors have not been able to figure out. I have numbness all over my body. I can hardly feel my genitals. My tongue is numb so I can't taste much anymore. And lately my digestive system has been starting to fail. So I have constipation all the time. Eventually I will probably need to drink all of my food.  Besides this, the nerves in my knees and elbows are badly damaged. So bending my knees and elbows hurts. It also makes my hands and feet go numb and very weak. I can't walk much more than a block or two unassisted at this point. I'm confined to bed much of the time. I could deal with all of this until the last week or so. My wife has been very helpful, but its becoming increasingly clear that she's getting tired of having to help me, and honestly, I'm tired of needing to be helped.

About a year ago when this all started I was suicidal. I told my wife to hide my gun so I wouldn't do anything stupid. Tonight I asked her to give it back to me. She didn't fight me on this. Tomorrow she is going to retrieve it from where she put it and I'm gonna end this crap. Its time. I'm past my breaking point and at this point I think its just sadistic to keep trying to push through all of this. I've been miserable for a long time. I think it will be a relief to finally have that gun in my hands."
380,Hey y'all I'm not really sure what I'm doing anymore.,"Hey so I don't mean to sound so pitiful about myself or overdramatic, I just need to get this off of my chest because I don't really have anyone else to tell this to. And I just want someone to hear me I guess.

I've been depressed pretty much as long as I can remember, and the suicidal thoughts only really came in after the 6th grade. I have a real hatred of myself and I can't really explain why, it just feels like I am not smart,beautiful or appreciative enough for anything I have. Though through my anxiety and self loathing I still managed to find some great friends who I'd do anything for they're amazing people, but do to my illness they've lost a lot of interest in me and I guess it should be expected nobody else wants to be around me including myself so why should they? Again I know I'm being dramatic I apologize I know my story isn't that bad or anything I'm just so tired of fighting and convincing myself people care about me and that I matter for something because I have yet to believe that I make a good difference for anyone. I just don't know what else to do. Thanks for reading this if you are I hope you are all doing well."

He is at work 3-12 and my parents are divorced so I am usually at home by myself and I just sit on my chair all day until 12 so I dont have to talk to him and I am just fat, stupid and unattractive so no one really likes talking to me. My dad is right about how I am useless and at this point i dont think there is any reason to live if I'm just going to sit in a dark room alone without anybody to talk to and love. I hate thinking about living the rest of my life like that but knowing it's my life would be if I decided to live. Sorry for wasting your time, it just felt good to get that off my chest."
384,My girlfriend is suicidal. Help!,"My gf of about a month (I've known her for years) recently told me that she is depressed and has already been through 2 attempts to end it all. I love her very much and I want to help however I can but she is extremely pessimistic about the future and I simply can't propose an argument to why she shouldn't be. This situation is tearing me apart because I have anxiety and my brain always thinks of the worst case scenario when things don't go smoothly.

Today we found out that her favorite band canceled their visit to our country but they would show up sometime later this year for sure. I told her it's OK, they'll be coming again so when that time comes we'll go together. She started saying things like ""who knows what's gonna happen until then"" which made me worry too much. So I asked what could possibly happen, but she wouldn't give a straight answer. I then brought up that I'm worried and that resulted in her saying ""I'm not going to say anything ever again. I shouldn't have opened up that day at all and I don't want to open up anymore. You already know too much.""

How am I supposed to handle this? The whole thing is eating away at me slowly and all I want is her well-being. It should also be noted that we are about 2 hours away by car, which makes things even more difficult because neither of us has a car. "

390,Ex friend keeps undermining my progress as a person,"I used to be a toxic person: insecure, selfish, envious of others. This ex-friend, she used to be a source of support, but eventually our friendship got very toxic since she was having problems and I am badly depressed. My depression just kept rubbing on her. She finds fault at everything I do. She resorted to manipulative/gaslighting (unintentional or not) and started blaming me whenever she's unhappy. She kept questioning my decisions back then, and the fights are explosive, with hints of gaslighting and manipulation in it.

It was a weird codependence thing, she wanted to fix me, and I wanted a friend. But it was too toxic to keep going. Eventually, I found the courage to leave her behind, because I can't see a future that I can grow with her. It was a past that I'm not proud of.

After 5 years of trying to get better, I was able to afford psychiatric treatment and got diagnosed with depression. My depression became manageable after a few months on meds, it stopped the train of bad thoughts in my head and helped me focus on what's important.  The peace gave me a better perspective of other people's experiences and the world. And I was able to find healthy relationships and great sources of support.

One of my old friends reconnected with me as well. She was a part of the friend group where me and my ex-friend were before. I felt very ashamed of my toxic past, but I took the chance of holding accountability of my actions and apologized. I asked how others are doing, even my ex-friend, but she said ex-friend is still not comfortable with what I've done. I've accepted the fact that I will not be able to apologize at all, and that it is something that I have to bear with for the remaider my life.

Everything was fine until ex-friend learned about my old friends reconnecting with me. She started writing them letters and started spewing out vitriolic things like ""once toxic always toxic"" and ""she is a festering pus"". I understand the anger but I don't think this is something I deserve.

Am I selfish to think that I should have a chance to change as a person? I feel bad and ashamed of my past. I know she's far away now but I believe she's still out to ruin my effort. I'm trying my best not to spiral down to depression.."

One year, two years, three years have passed and she wasn't able to get back to a proper job. She mostly worked freelance online during that time, and even had to work part time at a fastfood joint for us to afford bills. I told her no pressure, these things takes time.

Then one day, I got an email from my boss asking if I know someone who can fill a sudden vacant position. My wife fit the requirements and so I immediately told her about it. She said she wanted to try...

A couple weeks later of crossing our fingers, she finally got the job and now we're working together!

Granted, her workplace is at a different building, so we don't literally work together. But it's so awesome to sit next to her during our meetings, finding solutions to the same work problems, and it's fun to guide her how things work around here!

Our next happy problem is learning how to handle the influx of having our household income suddenly getting doubled. We were terrible in handling it and bought ourselves so many expensive gadgets with her first official salary. We need to go to a financial literacy seminar or something."

i have another friend who i hung out with for the first time 2 days in a row (she came over to my house for dinner then went home from school with me, we go to schools that are close to eachother) and she apologised for not being able to hang out today. honestly i'm surprised she wanted to be around me that long. 

the last time i yeeted my arm i took a bath to help hide it bc water usually hides marks on my arms (i dont yeet hard enough to bleed). today i yeeted after a bath because i associated the two things. now i have lines on my arm and a wardrobe of almost all short sleeves. 

i've been going to therapy for over a year now, but i don't know if it's helping. i don't know what i should feel like by now and i dont feel i can tell the therapist everything because im afraid she might tell my mom. a couple weeks ago i told her i was scared of bridges because i was afraid i was going to jump and she told my mom, who already knew but still that's something really personal and idk if i can do anything anymore

one of the things i do when i'm stressed or depressed is miss school, which means i miss a lot of school (not gonna go into it rn but let's just say i'd be fucked if i couldn't learn shit quickly). my dad's a teacher and he alwlays says shit to make me feel like it's my fault i'm missing school, and maybe it is. i tend to dissociate myself with my problems so idk if being depressed and not being able to deal with it is my fault or now

i guess the main reason i'm posting on here is because i want human connection and validation/to fish for compliments. fuck i wanna yeet"

408,Came out as bi to my parents today,"My mom started crying and my dad hasn't talked to me since. I overheard my mother talking to him and how she thinks I need to be ""fixed"" and I'm scared of what that's supposed to mean. Am I gonna die or have testosterone injections (which btw isnt how sexualities work especially when I have a good amount apparently). I hope I dont get tortured but maybe if they do kill me I'll be out of my painful single life so maybe something good will come out of this hell on earth."
409,GUYS!!!(and chicks and whatevs) my crush had successfully surgery and I’m hyped up and so grateful she is doing great.,She had some surgery done to remove something(don’t wan to say for privacy crud) but it helps her soooo much I’m really happy that she is doing good. Im texting her everyday to see how she is and being there however i can. I sent her a get well soon card and i cant even explain how happy i was when she first texted me after her surgery. She is coming to school. In a month’s time so thats that 🤯
410,BOYS (17 or above mainly) what about a girl makes you notice her?,"Wondering what most stands out to you or what catches your eye. I have this crush and I was just wondering what really makes you notice a girl? Is it their clothes? New haircut? 
Don't want any 'her ass' answers cuz that's kinda obvious with lads,but I mean personally to you what stands out? "

416,Nothing left to live for,"In the past 2 years I (22F) have lost just about everything I care about. I was kicked out by my dad and lost contact with my mom, siblings and niece/nephew, the rock of my friend group committed and we all lost contact, my cat died and then in April I failed out of university. Leaving me with loads of student debt and zero job prospects. All I have left is my boyfriend who I care about more than anything, but at this point I think he is wasting his time with someone like me and deserves better. 

I live meaninglessly and I don't even know why I get out of bed each morning anymore."

I called 5 different places near my home and all were either wildly expensive even with insurance, or not taking not patients. 

I have made a list of more places to call, but it is really discouraging and not as easy as people might think."

424,I can't form close relationships,I've been struggling with depression for the last 6 years off and on. One thing that's stuck with me through the years is the feeling of being disconnected from everybody. Unless someone is 110% like me and we form this meant-to-be relationship (I'm taking about friendship btw and nothing romantic) I just kind of watch them drift away. Or we stay as acquaintances for forever. I am not completely uncomfortable being around acquaintances and to them I probably seem very nice and talkative and social because I know how to be very likeable when there's a distance between me and the other person. And I know how to be full on bestie with someone. But the space between those two is just kind of... Blank. And most of the time I don't really care but sometimes it feels lonely.

427,"They say ""think of your friends and family"" to stop you from doing it...mine make me want to do it","I fucking hate them. I'm sick and tired of them fucking existing. I hate getting yelled at over stupid bullshit like fucking video games. My brother threw a fucking soda can at me because I didn't help him in Apex Fucking Legends. I had every right to grab him by the throat and slam his head into a wall until it was nothing but mush, honestly.

I'm sick of my mom waking me up early in the fucking morning on 4 hours of sleep to do shit for her and bitching at me for waiting. I'm sick of my dad not fixing my fucking car so I can't see my fucking friends. I'm sick of my one bitch ass crybaby useless friend who keeps bitching at me about stupid dnd, and acting like he's the fucking pinnacle of humanity just because he can point out my flaws in how I handled my dysfunctional childhood. Congratulations you little bitch, you can point out the flaws in how a disabled person handled being abused, bullied, and neglected by their fucking family. Good for you, fucking moron. I'm sick of all these fucking intrusive thoughts about times I got bullied in school and could have stuck up for myself. Honestly I just wish I was fucking dead. It would be fucking hilarious, fucking golden, to blow my fucking head off in the backyard where my brother and I used to have play sword fights with our cute little imaginary friends, and have that same shitty brother see his younger sibling dead in the same spot where he used to play and make all those fond little childhood memories. Imagining their reactions is honestly fucking cathartic. All their guilt, all their shame, all their fucking ignoring me and my problems. I was fucking bothered by what went on with mom too yaknow, how she tried to kill herself and how she is an on and off alcoholic,  I don't know where the fuck you get the nerve to act like you're the only fucking family hero you spineless bitch.

I’ve been struggling with anger issues lately- it got really bad in college, when one time, I just went fucking ballistic and started slamming my one friend’s head into the ground during a game of catch when he got too touchy with me, then when he called out my overreaction, I tried to punch him in the fucking face. I don’t know what came over me- it feels like I just get fucking possessed sometimes and I can’t control my actions.

I'm not gonna do it. At least not yet, or not for a long time...I think at least. Hopefully not ever. But god, making them suffer by showing them my corpse is honestly so fucking tempting.

In case it's not clear this post isn't usually how I act or talk. I'm just flipping out all the goddamn time and need to let it out.

Edit: I apologize for the harsh language, the mild vagueness I use to talk about things, and if this isn't appropriate for this sub, I'm just really going nuts."
428,Romanticism [RANT],"Hey! Sorry for the shitty title, but I find this ineffable. So I [17/M] have been depressed for quite a bit now, but lately shit's just getting out of hand. I have always been on ADHD medication, never tried antidepressants because I never felt like I needed them even tho I have been thinking about killing myself every single day for the past year, but now I just don't know how to do this, now everything just went out of control because a girl my age I used to party with. So this girl is like the best fucking girl on the entire planet, she's beautiful, smart, funny, honest and has her life totally planned. I like her so much, but not just in a romantic way, I mean I really love her as a person too. But guess what, she's not interested in me. What a fucking surprise huh? Well, I mean she wants a guy to have fun with and I'm a depressed shitbag, so I understand that, but I still can't bear knowing she will never love me back. It hurts a lot, but maybe if she just disappeard from my life I'm sure the pain would decrease with the pass of time. Thing is, she keeps coming back because of mutual friends, and I'm so happy when I see her, but then the next day I'm too close to just jumping out the window. I don't know for how long I will be able to play this game with her. I would just like her to A)Stay forever or B)Leave forever. I know it's not fair for her and that it's not her fault, but it just hurts a little too much right now. If you made it through this fucking mess of a text, thank you. I kinda love you all."
429,I'm not even going to act like I feel like trying anymore,"I hate working, but I also hate being unemployed. Either way I'm broke and I hate myself and I'm probably going to do it before anybody gets home. I literally don't have two nickels to rub together and if you think there's another way you're fucking delusional."
430,First real relationship,"Wow.
So, had a crush on this girl for a good 3-4 months. Asked her out on valentine's day. She said yeah. Now we're dating. We had our first date yesterday night. Her mom excepts both of us for who we are (unlike mine). We held hands. I wanted to kiss her so bad. But you know, her mom was there. I'll do it eventually. I said I love you, she said it back. I'm trying not to rush this like my dumbass parents. This is unreal for me."
431,When you put on a thick ass hoodie but for fucking once in Scotland’s history ITS FUCKING SUNNY,FUCKING SUNNY FUCK SUN ALL MY GOTH HOMIES HATE SUN
432,oml there are people that dont have to read labels,my brain cant process that there are people who don't read foodlabels bc they don't have allergies/ dietrestrictions etc. I literally ate porksalami in my nightmare and felt guilty cuz I'm muslim 😭
433,Asked the girl I've liked since 5th grade out after prom.,"Saturday was my senior prom, and I went with a girl I've liked on and off again since the 5th grade to go with me. With the help of my sister I bought her an eyeshadow palette and wrote on it ""It would be SWEET if you went to prom with me."" (and yes I meant sweet because it is a chocolate themed eyeshadow, Two Faced for anybody interested)  She says yes and I am beyond excited. Fast forward to Saturday, we go to the prom and have a great time eating and dancing together. Afterward we went to a restaurant that has fried ravioli, which she has been raving about so much, and I bought her an after prom dinner. So dinner goes just as good, if not better than the prom itself. So I take her home and right before she gets out of her car I ask her to be my girlfriend, which she gets very excited about and basically screams yes and hugs me so tight (well as tight as someone can when they are in different seats of a car lol). I am still in shock and so happy I finally got the courage to ask her out."
434,Relationships are dumb,garlic bread better
435,My girlfriend might have heart failure and I'm so scared,"I met her in December of last year and we started dating in January, we immediately fell in love and we were so happy, she recently became dry and I was wondering why and I was worried that I did something and I just found out she might have heart failure, I looked it up and it said that most people die in less than 5 years and in severe cases they die in a year. I'm freaking out because I love her so much and we even planned our lives together, I was gonna move to where she lives and we would happily live for years and get married. I don't know what I'm going to do if I lose her."
436,I told my mom about t-posing,"She deadass did it while she was arguing with my dad

*im so proud*"
437,How do you find the right therapist?,"I tried getting a referral from my psychiatrist, but I'm pretty sure he ended up not being right for me.  I usually felt like sessions were a step backwards.

I can get a list of psychologists in my area from my insurance company, but how do I know which one to use?  What questions do I need to ask? What do I need to tell them?

I'm pretty sure I'll just end up giving up soon.  Deciding that my current therapist can't help me has just solidified my belief that there's no help for me.  One or two more and I doubt there'll be any turning back."
438,I feel like I wear a mask.,"When I am around friends and out in public I act normal. I make jokes I have ""fun"" I try to have a good time. When I am not around anyone else I turn to my real self. I sit in my dark room and play battlefield. When my xbox live ran out it was hell. I just sat around in my room with no light and thought about life.this just made me more depressed. I really dont care about anyone (not even family)or anything execpt for xbox. wtf is wrong with me?"

442,How to stop flaking on people?,"I have been fighting my fight against this stupid disease for several years, and one thing that's gotten worse over the years is the amount of flaking I do. I have a lot of anxiety naturally, but I'm at the point now where I even make up fake excuses to people I really care about to not have to do anything socially. Like I made something up to stay home instead of hang out with this girl I've been seeing for months now. Like I'm comfortable with her why do I feel inclined to do this? I feel lonely each time I flake, but in the moment it feels right to me. I'm causing myself a lot of pain and sadness, please give some advice if you have any."

Then he opens the can of baked beans and invites everyone to take a sip. Most guys now have drank cold, baked beans from a can. We then continue to T-Pose and sing the HALO 2 Theme song.
Then About half of the guys go in to the shower room and *explicit*. We then come put and take a sip from The Bean Can again. Really feel like im a part of something. He then proceeds to dump the rest of the beans in the 3 sinks. The end. That was an epic bruh moment."

Don't get me wrong, life is great, if you look at it on paper. I'm going to a good university for a program that's supposed to be world class; I have no shortage of friends, and my family love me dearly. But I can't help but just feel empty.

I don't know how to describe it. All the pent up frustration and anger from the past from the people who've wronged me and from the missed opportunities came flying out and it's just overwhelming. All the people who I knew judged me suddenly struck a nerve even though I'll never see them again. 

I'm not sure what I'm working for, to be honest. I don't know why I feel empty. I'm not sure if this even belongs here or if I'm just being a little bitch, but all of it just boiled over today (finally) and I feel like I'm just about done. "

465,"I've been talking to this girl I wanna go out with, but I found out her parents swindled my dad years back...","Alright, so this is a really long story and I swear to God it's not fake, even though if I were reading this on Reddit I would totally think this was made up,  me being my cynic self.  Alright so back to my main subject. I'll lay out some backstory first. My dad owns rental properties and has rented out apartments/ houses for about close to a decade maybe and has had some people not pay their rent and under my states law, you can't kick somebody out for not paying rent and they have something like 6 months that they can stay without being forced to pay. So when I was like 8 this family moved into one of my dad's houses. Everything seemed good at first but then they wouldn't pay their rent come time and my dad kinda gave them a break for like two months or so, but then he tried to evict them. Then things got ugly... They apparently knew their way around the system and basically were living in my dad's house and he was having to pay for their electric, water, etc., And so needless to say he was ticked off and they cursed him out and his kids gave my dad and family the finger. It was a living h*ck. We finally got them out but my dad was left with a destroyed house and 6,000 dollars lost. Now let's fast forward 8 years. My school district let's highschool students go to a vocational school in the county if they want throughout 10th,11th, and 12th grade. Since I've started going this year I've had to deal with multiple girls wanting to date me, once again I'm surprised as anyone else since I've never been in these situations before. A week ago, this girl asked my friend on the bus for my phone number and so he gave it to her and I've been talking to her over the past week and so far, I think I really like her. I found out what her last name was and it was oddly familiar but I thought it was maybe just a coincidence. Welp... I was talking to my sister about it and she looked her up on Facebook and it turns out her and her parents were the ones that gypped my dad 8 years ago and I'm just left here half chuckling about all this and I don't know how to handle the situation with her. Any advice at all would be appreciated because I'm completely baffled."

471,The world's hardest question,"I wake up everyday at 6 AM, and I go to bed at 10 PM. If I feel anxious about something, I'm up until 12 sometimes. 

I work with lawyers, but more specifically, with clients at a law clinic. I hear countless stories of people who desperately need help with all sorts of legal problems. I wish I could help them all, but I'm just a receptionist. To be a lawyer, one has to be disciplined and sharp. A lot work long days, researching and reading and writing. To be a lawyer, you need passion.

""What's your passion?"" 

I have no fucking clue. I feel tired all the time. Everyone around me talks about their passions. They have jobs in their fields. They post on social media about ""the grind."" I just want to lay down all day. I used to have passion. I loved my classes in school, but now that I am out, I feel unmotivated to do anything. I can't bring structure to my own life. I should be studying for the LSAT, but I can hardly focus when I'm alone. I can hardly focus at all. 

I day dream a lot. Arguably too much. I like to think about my life as a famous musician. Someone who's opinion makes an impact. I know I'm not that important or smart, but its nice. Sometimes, I think about suicide. Don't think I want to do it, but still imagine myself doing it. 

Most of my days are a blur. I go on reddit, social media. I text my girlfriend, my buddies. They know about my thoughts, but its hard to connect with people on how it feels. They all tell me to go to therapy, and I finally got one.

It's time to wake up. Hopefully. "

477,"On average, why do girls get better grades than guys?",They walking around with A+s and I'm just sitting here with my b's. I mean surely they've got uneducational things to do that they do more than studying! 
478,Are my parents controlling or am I just crazy.,"I really love my parents and they obviously do love me but I just wanted to ask my fellow children whether or not my parents are controlling. I think I'll just do a list of things they do.

* They're always listening to me talking on the phone and always criticizing everything I say to my friends. (e.g. I said to my friends obviously joking that I'll just steal pens from them throughout the school year, and my parents lectured me for 20 minutes about how bad a reputation I give my parents because of that)
* They're always shaming me about wanting to hang out with my friends and are always telling me to stay home because I don't spend enough time with them
* I'm not allowed to do normal teen stuff, e.g. ride bikes, go on the bus, go to sleepovers
* They're always telling me in Hindi ""If we were in India you would get hit"" 
* They see any sign of slight standing up for myself as an act of extreme disrespect and then are grumpy and angry at me for the rest of the day and then when they finally start to let it out they yell at me for a good 20 minutes.
* They're always emailing people to solve my problems even when I specifically tell them I'll do it myself (I get that this is another thing about caring about me but they've done this so many times)
* My dad is super obnoxious and acts like a kid when I do something wrong, just last week when I was late to my volunteer job and got in his car, which I presumed we were going in, he started getting into my moms car and drove out of the parking lot and started cackling when I got in.
* They're always calling me a ""punk"" and that I need to straighten myself up even though I'm a straight-A student and have never gotten in trouble at school.
* This is just a story to get off my chest but when I was 8 years old in grade 4 I got a B in french (I live in Canada) and my parents got so mad about it they would yell at me at separate intervals over a 2 week period until I started crying because, again, I was 8 years old.
* Just today my mom yelled at me for saying ""See you later"" to one of my friends who is a girl, and when I asked why its wrong she said ""It's our culture (Insert Name Here) it's how it is"" 

Anyway, this was just to get something off my chest, I'd write more but whatever. I'd add a rant flair but I can't do more than one flair."
479,Today my dear friend committed suicide,"He was always suicidal but so was I and together I thought both of us would make it through. We would always play games together to ease the pain but eventually it got to him, since I wasn’t there. We drew separated from each other so one day I decided to check up on him only to get a response from his brother telling me he passed from killing himself. It really did crush me and I feel like I won’t be able to make it without him since we both relied on each other"
480,Anyone else fake a smile too well?,"I'm depressed as f*ck, but I've become so well of putting up a smoke screen that even when I'm with the GP, I feel like they don't believe me because I come across so normal."
481,my future is blank,"I've been depressed and suicidal ever since I was a kid, ever since I first entered school. I never fit in with the kids. I was too bright, I was autistic, I looked retarded to the naive mind of the public. The depression has completely dulled out my brain. It used to be only so bad, but it's getting worse and worse. Everything is foggy, I can never concentrate, my speech is declining, and I have nowhere to go. I'm moving out of an abusive home in a week and I'm still not sure how I'll manage my finances, I just know I have to. I used to be so interested in psych, I used to manage a 3.6 GPA atop of all this, everybody kept saying I had such a bright future. Fuck it. I have nothing to do, nothing to look forward to. I ruined my GPA last year of high school and have no access to psych anymore. Nothing else really makes sense, and my interests are blank. My life is, my future is, everything is fucked. There's no point. "

484,I’m not single anymore,After years I finally found my soul mate. It’s the best thing that ever happened to me and I’m so in love. And it’s like when am around and talking to that person the best in me just comes out and I feel like I don’t do anything wrong anymore and I can truly just enjoy myself and feel strange maybe because it never happened to me. Oh I forgot to mention it’s a boy yep a bf and he’s everything I ever wanted and even so much more he just made my shitty summer into the best I ever had and I couldn’t thank him enough for it. He’s also so sweet always there for me except when he’s sleeping because he lives across the world but idc cause he’s wondering sweet loving and very romantic it’s been a week and it’s the best experience I ever had
485,No amount of therapy would ever help me. I am gone beyong insanity!,"I am 21 years old trapped in  vicious cycle of mistakes for years. Same mistakes again and again and again. PROCASTINATION for years!
I failed my classes, wasted my parents money and lost all friends. Lots of people tried to help, but I never changed. I don't want to improve. I don't want money or success. I love being loser and having problems. I am comfortable with whining and ranting about how fucked up I am!
There are many things about me which are disgusting like
1. Relationships
I don't seem genuinely interested in people. I am nice to people, give fake compliments and never cross them. I enjoy sympathy. Smallest of incidences will decide if a person is evil or good. Splitting is the best world for me. I have delusions of grandeur. I feel like I am special.
I don't want help from anyone, but I will help someone for prasies. I don't care about my family or anyone genuinely. 
2. Females
I never had a girlfriend. Even, if I get one I wouldn't mind getting cheated on. If she cheats on me I won't feel anything. I would love ""swinging"". I don't want children. I am more happy in porn, than real girls. My fantasies are the best for me. 
3. Daydreaming
 Most of my life I have spent in my head. Every situation that happens in a day, I replay them in my head and me being a hero than pussy. I daydream about being successful and I love it. I am addicted to daydreaming. 
4. Violent fantasies and disgusting
I have violent sexual fantasies which I won't go into details. Some fantasies are disgusting beyond human comprehension. I am ashamed of that. I never felt the urge to hurt some innocent.
5. My intelligence
This is the most fucked up thing about me. I have never been tested, but I think I have low IQ. I have given online IQ test and didn't even manage to score about 130. You will say online IQ tests are not real. Then why on the earth didn't I score above 125.
Since childhood I always felt something was wrong with my intelligence. I lacked common sense and couldn't figure out things. Even simple tasks were daunting. 
I wanted to be a genius,but I ain't a one. Then what's a point in life. I would be rather a miserable genius than a low IQ individual. Crying on a lambhorgini is much better than a bus.
6. Grandiosity and above the law
 I always daydream about being superior to people and above the law. Law is shit!
I daydream about being like Dexter Morgan  or uncaught vigilantes who hunts pedophiles/terrorists. I have fantasies of wrapping most wanted fugitives alive in gift wrapping in front of  interpol office by signing my name. There will be lots of podcasts about me and mysteries. While I would be sitting in my room, drinking tea and laughing at people. Law enforcement are shit and a vigilante is on loose more capable than CIA/KGB 
7. Trying to achieve/do impossible things
 I want to solve remaing 6 millennium mathematical problems and spent time reading about them or want to invent something which will revolutionize the world.

8.EXTREME EXPECTATIONS AND FAIlURE
I don't want to be like average Joe. For example my exam is in 1 month. It's a law entrance and I am thinking of studying for 22 hours a day. The score required for top college admission is 120/150, but I want to achieve 150/150 or else I will kill myself. It's better to get 150/150 or 0/150. Nothing between it, it's just like normal people.
I don't do it and get depressed. 
I am suicidal for last 6 months

9. Suicide as an option
For me suicide is an escapism. If anything goes wrong I will kill myself. I can escape anything. I think I suicide as special power. I don't need to take responsibility if I am going to kill myself anyway. Law won't do be shit if I am dead. Nobody can do anything if I am dead. If life doesn't goes according to me I will die. I hate god. I am ashamed to admit it, I blame god for my situation. I abuse god and yell loudly at god's idol. 
Nothing can change me."
486,Weird Dream lol,"So in this Dream the Nazis came back and invaded my country (slovenia) (very small) and that was it, nothing else just a small tiny european country that noone really gives a shit about 

Like in the dream I was thinking ""wait what, why doesn't anyone like help out and stuff, like the Nazis came back and overthrew a country, why does noone give a shit""

I also remember being with a group of people and we were walking through the forest cause we were trying to escape the Nazis hunting us, and then they found us but I ran away from the group so they all died while i was in a hiding spot

Then I climbed a tree and just kinda formed a lil nest-like spot where I was just kinda chilling, like I was on the phone in the trees and shit just kinda enjoying the peace and quiet of a forest 

And then I kinda woke up and that was it 

Oh and also it was a 2 parter 

like the night before I dreampt of the invasion happening which was just me chilling at home and my mom just told me that we were invaded 

And today was the me chilling in the tree nest thing"

I've spent years in therapy, medication, and doctors offices. I just don't want to have life. It doesn't intrest me, I dont like it, I dont want it, I dont need it. can't just die because I will cause my family and husband the pain my father inflicted on us but damn ain't being a life a bitch..."

491,A WEIRD QUESTION, can i eat your butt and suck your toes  ;//
492,Dangerous daydreams,"Why do I fantasize about going down really bad paths or think about horrible things happening to me all the time? I'll think about getting hooked on drugs, or being attacked, or something else really bad happening. These thoughts can get really dark, but I don't think of them in the way I think about death and dying so what are these for?"
493,im fucking sick of everything,"i’m so sick of everything. i was doing ok for a bit. i started getting excited that i was finally getting better then i start getting harassed with homophobia from people in my class. getting called faggot and lesbo. and telling me to “take a joke”.

i’m fucking sick of it. i’m sick of everything. i’m so fucking tired. thank you to those people in my class who make me want to kill my self again. thank you for making me want to cut myself again. 

it took so much strength in me just to contain myself from self harming again. and thank you for making me experience my first panic attack. thank you. thank you for making me realise that the world isn’t changing. that the world will always stay the same. that i will have to spend the rest of my miserable life fighting against people who believe saying slurs is funny.

i’m starting to lose hope. i just want everything to be over."
494,"If you want friends, be friendly.",¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
495,I think the person whom I've been talking to may have just committed suicide...,"Update. He's stil alive, but it was real close.

I've been talking to a person who made a post about wanting to kill themselves for a few days now.

I messaged him a few hours ago after not talking for a few days, the only response I got was that his problems had gotten worse.

That was a few hours ago, I've tried to contact him for a few hours now, but to no avail.

*3 hours now"
496,the stray dog that used to chill around my neighborhood just got back after few weeks,"he was a puppy when i saw him for the first time, i used to feed him and get him some water until he disappeared few weeks ago and i just saw him today while getting something from the supermarket and he got himself a new dog friend. he ran at me when he saw me i'm very happy that he found some company after being lonely here"
497,I DID IT BOIS!!! I GOT A GIRLFRIEND!!!!!,But she goes to a different school so you don’t know her.
498,Are we all seeking the serenity of sleep?,"That golden moment when we feel ourselves drifting into the darkness in the middle of the night. I know you all, every one of us stares up at the ceiling each night and prays; please God, please don't let me wake up tomorrow, let me never wake up from this slumber for I can't take another day. Every one of us on here curses the moment we wake up, wishing that we can slink back into the thoughtlessness of sleep for only another minute. We curse the seconds awake and count them down until we can curl up beneath the sheets and drift off yet again. The sleep is where we find comfort, and that great slumber is what we seek."
499,typing this while my moms not paying attention to me. what do i do im freaking out,"long story short, my mom and i played a qna game while my phone was charging and i was afraid shitless she was gonna ask me a question about boyfriends and then if i lie she’ll say “thats a lie i snooped through your phone”. we’re not as attentive as we were in the game as earlier but she’s still asking questions and im scared we’ll get to that point

503,I don’t feel like I’m really here,"I need to talk about this somewhere so I thought i’d post it here!!! when i’m with my friends I don’t feel like i’m really there. I talk, but none of the words I say really feel like they’re me. I don’t feel like this when i’m with my very best friend or my family, so i’m wondering if it’s just because i’m not super close to these other friends? but it’s really annoying bc after I finish hanging out with them, I never feel satisfied, or like I had the best time that I could have had.
I also have a problem with never being satisfied with most of my friends. I feel like I won’t find anyone in my city who really clicks with me. I have super close friends from camps, but none of them live here.
I just feel disconnected when i’m witj my friends and distracted so that I can’t get the right words out and I can’t think straight.
lol whatevaaa also THIS IS NOT SERIOUS PLS MAKE JOKES"
504,I'm back and worse than ever,"I posted before on here about how I'm depressed, a worthless piece of shit and how I tried to hang myself. The driving urge to kill myself faded into a dull ache for a few days and now I'm even more depressed. They say you'll regret suicide but I wish I had the guts to do it sooner. If you could get guns in the UK I'd be gone already

507,So I'm not sure if I have the virus...,"Before I begin, I just wanna say that I'm not looking for karma or anything, I just wanna say it and recieve your opinion on my condition.

It all began two weeks ago, when my grandpa visited our house. It was a regular meetup, talking, playing all that. It was very fun.

A few days later we recieved reports of him testing positive for the virus. We were shocked and worried, mainly because of the fact that he just turned seventy, and that we have had many diseases related to our respiratory system. I myself had pneumonia when I was three. So this has had a toll on our respiratory system.

A week after we have recieved the news, I started coughing (roughly? hardly? strongly? i don't know tbh). This scared me because it had been two weeks after our grandpa's visit, and two weeks was usually the incubation period for the virus. A few days after the all the coughing, sneezing and fevers (i had a mask on all the time, don't worry), my parents decided to have me quarantined in my room.

So here I am, coughing, sneezing, feeling unnecessary tired, and the uncertainty is killing me. I'll give an update on my condition as soon as I can.

Hopefully I get well.

TL;DR : Grandpa visits my house, tests positive a few days later, I start getting sick, and now I am quarantined in my room"

511,Vaping/smoking is ruining this school.,"The school closed down one of the bathrooms because students kept bringing juuls and weed. Now the whole school is stuck sharing two sets of bathrooms that are always crowded. If you're one of these people wo smoke or vape at school, kindly ruin your lungs somewhere else and leave everyone else out if it. You're not cool. You're not rebellious.

513,17m and falling for my f buddy,"We hadn't put a name tag but this usually helped. We are friends since 2 years and she is really close to my family. Last new years I got piss drunk and kissed her, didn't know about it until an entire week later. After that we are friends (she has set me up with my crushes some times and gives genuine relationship advice) but we get intimate many times. It is slightly scary and I have asked her a million times that if she actually has feelings for me and she keeps on saying no but I somehow feel she is lying. Anyway recently, I have been having thoughts about us being in a relationship (she is far better than any past ones) but I don't want to ruin us by going first and looking like an idiot. 
I guess I should ask her to just stay friends or something idk man. 
P.s. Am I an idiot for wanting a relationship with my f buddy?"

I know things better than what it seems but I've driven myself to the point of isolation and hatred that I'm making myself so much worse.

539,some CERTAIN people are pressed because i spoke the truth,can you guess who they are :0
540,I feel like the help is fabricated fantasy,"When you talk to anyone, a doctor, and friend, or read an internet post. There is always this rumour about how depression is fine once you get help, but further you go into it, the more you give into the bluff there is dead ends. 

In the UK at least, they say the antidepressants help, they may you feel more guilt and less likely to kill yourself, but in the end I end up numb and trapped in my own body and the doctors going silent when I tell them. Then they prescribe therapy. Lol therapy. CBT. So a graduate can ask me the same questions off a list every week with the voice of a hotel receptionist. Just try and do a little more each day, I feel so pathetic. Talk therapy? Apparently doesn't exist unless you have money. I feel like my mother is pushing for me to live but that's it, I can't anymore. I'm young but I already can't live with my own mind any longer. I'm sick of waiting in the misery of my own mind while people tell me that help is coming, someone will show me how to fix my brain. It's just a sham to get me to forget about it."
541,a year ago today i tried to end my life,"its been a year since i almost ended my life in my bath tub amid feeling overwhelming stress and anxiety, i remember feeling so much dread all the time that i felt committing suicide would be better than going on living.


since then, i’ve worked real hard with online counselors and my family who has helped me a whole bunch and ive left my toxic friend circle and have really fun supporting friends and ive been working out a lot over quarantine and now honestly I am for once genuinely happy to be with the people i love and to talk to friends 

I just wanted to share with you guys that, and hopefully let other people like me know that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that counseling and therapy, on or offline really helps you just got to take the first steps, i did it because of how guilty i felt about how scared i made those closest to me, you guys if you are feeling suicidal or depressed should reach out to your loved ones because what surprised me was how willing and open they were to helping me! I honestly thought back then that I wasn’t depressed and that I was making it up in my head but now I know that I am and that it isnt a bad thing, its just something for me to work on everyday. Please reach out to people you love, i love you guys thank you for reading if you did!"
542,To the fakers...,"I was diagnosed with aspergers syndrome at 11 years old. I attended therapy for a week beforehand and have spent the past 4 years attempting to learn social cues and become a generally better person.

I view mental disorders as a checkov's gun. One that can be fired in your favour or against it.

Recently, I've noticed a disturbing trend of gen z faking mental disorders for clout. As someone WITH a mental disorder and likely more due to reasons I won't explain here, I find this behavior to be repulsive, disrespectful and downright offensive. I have not only seen grown men use DID as an excuse for pedophilia, one of my friends claims to have ADHD. This, i find to be worrying.

I have NO problem with believing to have a disorder. I believe I have a few myself, however there is a distinct difference. I never outright say I have these disorders, I merely wait to be diagnosed. This is because I respect people who have these disorders, and don't wish to be singled out for something I don't have (which has happened before). This is what I STRONGLY urge you all to do.

Most of you are clearly very creative people, and I don't want to diminish that. I would suggest writing stories about the characters you create instead of claiming to be them. Secondly, don't pretend to be a person that you are not, I've seen people pretending to be dsmp characters, which could potentially ruin their careers.

In general, it seems to me like this community you have built is made on a foundation of lies and mistrust. Every perceived slight could be blamed on an alter or a mood swing.

A word of advice. Please stop

This is for your sake mainly, and also for that of people struggling with these disorders. Your community depicting them as 'cute' or 'quirky' only hurts people, and I will never respect ANYONE who partakes in this disgusting behavior.

Don't be the generation that kills respect.

Be the one who rises to challenge and helps those who truly need help."
543,"This middle aged woman said ""kids need to get off their phones and look where they're going""","She was directing it at me so I just made a face and turned around.

She immediately ran right into a railing.

These are confusing times"
544,"Anxiety leads to being alone, leads to sadness, leads to hopelessness, leads back to anxiety...","All the time I wish I was someone different. 
Someone more appealing, someone more fun to be with, someone people are excited to be around.

But I always feel like I never measure up. Like the reason people have left me in the past is because I'm not good enough. What if I'm not ever good enough for anyone? I have such a low opinion of myself that I cannot seem to wrap my head around why anyone--friends, family, coworkers even want to spend time with me or talk to me. I keep trying to convince myself I don't need anyone, but it gets lonely. Yet I just keep pushing people away, trying not to make ties to anyone so as to not get hurt. 

Every time I feel like I am improving, I regress back to the person I was when I first started recognizing I was probably depressed. 
Telling someone about this realistically probably won't happen. My mother has frequently expressed her opinion on mentally ill people. She thinks they should be all ""locked up"" no matter what the problem--depressed, suicidal, etc. My dad is pretty ignorant of mental illness, he says that we never heard about people having these problems in earlier times, so they are probably just made up problems now. My sister would pity me. My friends would back away slowly (to be kind) and then I'd probably never hear from them. 

So here we are. I am convinced I am just not trying hard enough and this make me feel even worse because I know this is my fault for being the way I am. I have the capability of being outgoing and getting to know people, and being friendly, but instead I cocoon myself and stay quiet, and avoid others as much as possible. I lash out at anyone who has a criticism. I then feel badly about it later. I dunno, it's hard sometimes not to feel like I am such a hazard to myself. I sabotage my own happiness at every turn, and yet I long for it. "

546,"This is a story of emotional abuse and deepening hurt.. There are many like it, but this one is mine...","Where to begin where to begin.... Well, I suppose a little background is in order first..


I am the middle of three brothers, 20, 19, and 1. My mom and dad divorced when i was a mere 4 years old. Both my mom and dad have a history of depression, and both eventually had to take anti-depressants for a period of at least 6 months to a year.

My older brother, we'll call him Danny, was definitely born the athletic one. He showed interest in sports at a very early age, and was playing t-ball as early as first grade. My parents absolutely adored him, as they were both very athletic themselves all the way through high school. This, however, would have tragic implications for me..

I, on the other hand, was born as the brains of the litter... I was always interested in reading, was counting to 100 at age 1, and loved to watch my dad play video games until i could do the same (at age 3). I didn't show that same interest as my brother, so while he was at his t-ball games, I was on the sidelines, just reading a book.

Fast-forward to 3rd grade. Danny tells mom that he wants to play football. So she signs us both up and gets very into getting us prepared. First week of practice, my brother clearly has a little bit of an idea what he's doing. I, on the otherhand, have no idea, as i've never so much as watched a single game at that age. The year dragged on like this, He continues to excel while I continue to fall behind...

4th grade and memories of the year before still fresh in my mind (grueling work, no reward) I ask my mom to stop playing football.... I still remember the disappointment in her voice as she said ""Oh... but your brother will still be playing.... are you sure..?""... I told her I was. So that's when things got bad. As she was a single mom working full time and my dad had yet to come back into my life for more than a day or two every other week, she had to juggle a lot of things... Unfortunately, my brother won out far more frequently. She managed to find time to attend every one of his games from 4th grade through junior year (even driving as far as 70 miles away), while she never made it to any of my awards nights, none of my honor roll banquets, none of my field trips to the planetarium.....

Another leap, this time to Freshman year of high school... There I was, strapped into all my football gear, ready to try this once again because my dad was now thoroughly a part of our lives again. I wanted to make my parents proud and not just be left on the sides or home alone reading books all day.. It worked for a while, they started coming to my games when they could, even though mine were on Thursday and his was on Fridays... My dad and my step mom even went so far as to pick me up and hang out with just me on days where I was feeling down... But this wasn't meant to last..


Sophomore year of highschool, and things started going worse... I had just broken up with my girlfriend of two years, whom I had been totally convinced had cheated on me, finished my second year in a row on honor roll all year, and had been a starter on my JV football team when it happened: my brother announced he was joining the Marines after his Senior year. Things were immediately cast into motion.


That summer, he tears some muscle in his ankle while at football practice. Immediately, my mom and dad pitch in money to send him to the best physical therapy that they could afford. They sink all their time not spent at work helping him to be the best that he could for when he was to be deployed. Which meant this: no more going to my football games, no more talking to me when i was depressed, nothing. I saw my mom when i ate dinner after practices, and then went to my room to do homework and then play video games. I got to drive myself to all my games, work outside of class just to pay for gas, let alone lunch and a phone, and I had maybe one person I could call a friend.


At my brother's deployment, my mom began trying to get me to join, saying ""oh, just go in for one deployment, and do something that you'll find interesting, be a mechanic or a pilot or something"". Well, I had other intentions, and even after her making me take the ASVAB and scoring a perfect on it, I broke the news to her: ""I'm going to college, and not the military"". It all just broke. Her only response? ""Why couldn't you just be more like your brother...?""

That year, I met another girl, got into a car crash with her in the passenger seat, and saved her life, preventing her from hitting the dash and protecting her at impact, then kicking out the door of the newly totaled pick-up we were driving. I suffered a concussion and screwed up my back and she was unharmed. We were in love, until she guilt tripped me anytime she wanted anything at all, or anytime I wanted to do something that she didn't, or anytime that things weren't going just perfectly for her at home. So we broke up after high school graduation....


Meanwhile, my mother files me under her taxes, while i'm working a full-time job at minimum wage Little Caesar's just to pay for my college. So no financial aid. No problems. I started going out with my first girlfriend again.. My mother gives me zero support, emotional, physical, or otherwise. I have very few people to turn to, and my depression just keeps getting worse and worse with no one to really turn to....

Well, there's my life story... AMA I guess, or something...

TL;DR Born smart, not athletic. My brother gets ALL the love and attention for his sports and future. My family looks down on me and no longer supports me for working and going to college full time. Depression is at its worst tonight."
547,C rush reject me am mega sad heheh,See crush reject me now feel bad for me
548,Remembering that one time in 6th grade when I intentionally tripped a kid in basketball and threw the ball at his head,I've had anger issues forever

551,"Shy crush, idk if I'm being rejected.","I know I'm oblivious when it comes to reading people's feelings, and I want to know if I'm being rejected or no. Cause if I am I don't really want to look like a creep who keeps trying even if he has no chances.

So, my crush is really really shy. Since she didn't have her friends in the class, I became her friend so she wouldn't be left alone. She's been nice to me since the beggining of the year but I also feel like she's being distant :

- For example, we're in a charity group and we work in a place every weeks. The available schedules are Saturday morning and Wednesday afternoon. Pretty much everyone has chosen Saturday morning expect her, she chose Wednesday afternoon knowing she'll be without us.

- The way she texts is pretty ""formal"" ( if that makes sense), even tho she claims to text like that to everyone. 

- She never makes a move when we have the occasion to sit next to each other, or when she's sitting alone. Making me the one to suggest that we could actually sit next to each other everytime.

The result is me always reaching out for her. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining because of that. But it feels kinda weird, like if I was bothering her. I mean she never reached out for me because she said she doesn't know what to talk about or do, idk...

Idk if all of that is the consequence of being shy or if she straight up doesn't want me around. What do you think?

TL;DR : my crush is very shy, idk if she doesn't want me around or if it's normal."

I just want to get some advice. All my songs sound similar to other more popular songs and I feel like I'm copying them now. Is there anything I can do?

So, I'm not proposing my crush until she tells me to do so. I know she won't tell me directly but I'm not as dumb as my siblings and friends may be parents too think I am. I'll check out the hints.

Still I might hold for a long time of days to analyze those. I guess eventually in the time frame she may do the thing too. Who has seen the future anyway. 

Wish me luck bois and gals. My morning has changed my mind. It's a new day with a new me and a new vision for the future.

In a school that's just for royalty

I'm so excited to be (Sofia the First)

Making my way, it's an adventure every day (Sofia)
It's gonna be my time (Sofia)
To show them all that I'm Sofia the First"

561,"If anyone deserves to die, it is me [x-post]","I'm the definition of a failure. 


I can barely care for myself, not because I suffer from a disability, but because I'm literally afraid of everything. 

I'm a 26 year old still living with family and quite dependent on my mother and family for meals and tasks. I see myself being stuck in this position for the remainder of my life. 

It has taken 25 years for me to get my first job (a temporary one). I have work related anxiety, which is why it has taken me so long.  After the first month and a half, I was burned out. I wasn't doing difficult work, but I couldn't mentally handle the 5am alarm, 9-5 work day 5 days a week. So I was unusually happy when I was let go, because finally I could finally get a break.


I don't have a real job anymore. I make 5 dollars a day filing out surveys. 


My insurance has expired (w/ my mother) and I don't qualify fur any other insurance other than Medicaid, which honestly is nothing anyway. I'd rather pay the 95 dollar penalty for no insurance. 


I don't even have my own car,  nor a license because I'm scared of driving and no one has the patience to deal with me having panic attacks in a vehicle. 


I have no passions or interests in anything. I only do stuff now to distract me.


So now with no insurance, no job,  no car, barely any money, no goals, no interests, nobody who sees me as a potential partner (why would they though? ) and no way out why should I even remain alive? It would require more money and time caring for me, than my own funeral.


*TLDR* It wasn't meant for me to live as an adult because I can't handle it. "
562,I’m scared of life...,So senior year is coming up and I’m sort of freaking out. I have to start applying for colleges and scholarships and I also have to get my drivers license to drive to college. All of this obviously means that once high school is over I become an adult and I have to start living in the real world. I’m so scared and I’m not really having a good summer so far as everyday I keep worrying about this upcoming school year and the years after it.
563,I'm fucking done,"TL;DR: I didn't want to eat with my family, mom gets really pissed and breaks shit, and now I'm even more depressed.

Ok so basically my mom called me up to eat, I went there and my whole family (3 younger sibling, mom, stepdad) were all at the table. I decided I didn't want to eat with them because I don't really like talking to people and my family eats like cows (smacking lips, chewing really loudly) so I went back downstairs to continue playing with my friends. My mom storms downstairs and begins to yell at me, breaks my computer monitor, throws my phone across the room (thankfully I have an otterbox so it wasn't damaged) and drags me upstairs to eat with some ""you have to listen to what I say"" bullshit. I'm already super depressed for other past traumas (such as surviving a murder attempt) and mental illnesses and I'm too scared to kill myself and I just don't know where to go. I am currently in my room crying while typing this."

I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address, in the torn up town

Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows that we're fine with this
We didn't come from money
But every song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Ooh ooh oh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair
And we'll never be royals
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler, you can call me Queen B
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

Tried to stave it off by more work in the same quick pace, but it only lasted for another 30 minutes then I was back to being x x x sad. I've never noticed this in regards to how my depression functions, so I was wondering: does anyone else have this happen?"

The funeral is in 3 days, but I won't be there, since the plane and train tickets together are allready almost a thousand dollars for my mom alone, I didn't know him super well, as I moved away from my home country when I was 5, and only saw him once a year at most, but he was an extremely kind hearted person, a great storyteller, a good boxer and an marvelous actor."

Enjoy not having any friends or freedom in your new home. What's that? You started to put down roots in your new state after nearly a year of feeling lost and you're finally going to take the roadtrip you've been dreaming of since you were a little girl? Sorry! Turn around after your first night on the road because someone offered you a spiked beer at a campfire and r\*ped you and the police called your mom at 2am to come get you and now you can't eat or drink unless you're stoned and you can't go out in public and when people look at you you feel like you're going to shrivel up and die. Oh wait a minute! You got into college in a different country and GOD you could use a fresh fucking start somewhere else, but surprise, you get there and your grandfather dies and you can't fly home for the funeral and you can't even remember the last time you spoke with him. And now you're trapped in a foreign country during a pandemic too, just as a little fucking extra bonus.

I've been catatonic-level depressed since December. I'm so fucking tired. The only thing my antidepressants seem to be doing is giving me enough energy to where I'm even more aware of how ridiculous my entire life is. I'm so tired and I just want out.

I was keeping it together and the only one not crying, but when my mum came home from the hospital I just broke down. I loved that old man, back when I was little he pretty much raised me.

586,question about GPA,alright so I am wondering what grades I would have to get in order to get a 3.75 GPA or a 3.5 I'm a sophomore and i've gotten a 3.0 all throughout high school but im in my second semester of sophomore year and I can probably tryhard and get really good grades but I'm just wondering what grades I'd have to get in order to get a 3.5 or 3.75 for the remainder of highschool
587,A realization I had last night,"You can downvote this if you want, I just wanted to get it off my chest.  Also I'm not the best at putting my thoughts on paper, but here goes.

I've had suicidal feelings for over a decade now.  I've always felt like a misfit, like I just don't belong here and like the world would probably be a better place without me.  Lately things have been worse than usual, for reasons I won't go into.  Last night I sat on my bed, absolutely miserable, thinking about mixing some Vicodin I had with alcohol.  It would make it so easy to end everything.  I'd just fall asleep and never wake up.

But then I thought, what if I'm wrong about death?  What if death isn't actually the end?  I'm not talking about an afterlife, I still don't believe in that.  What I'm trying to say is that existence is all I've ever known, and what if there just isn't a way to avoid it?  

I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty convinced that the universe is one consciousness experiencing itself.  It might seem like when a person dies they're gone forever, but really they continue to exist: in you and me and everything else.  I remember when I first encountered this idea I thought it was completely stupid, but eventually I felt it could be a possibility.

When you think about killing yourself you think you understand death.  You think it is a solution to your problems.  What if it's not the solution?  What if you're always going to exist some way or another?  That sort of terrified me last night, because I had always imagined being able to escape existence through death. 

I'm sorry if this is not helpful or if it makes you feel worse.  It definitely made me feel worse at first last night.  For the past 10 years I thought suicide would be my escape, but with this new doubt in my mind I doubt I'll be killing myself any time soon.  I suppose if I was desperate enough I might try it, but I'm really beginning to believe there is actually no escape from existing.  

**TLDR I acknowledged that I didn't understand death and that it might not offer the release I wanted.  Thinking you understand death (and life too) is presumptuous and even foolish, in my opinion.  Instead of focusing on how I'm going to escape life, I'm going to try to accept it and embrace it.**

Also if you are feeling down I would recommend maybe trying meditation or looking into some of the teachings of Buddhism, because those have helped my outlook on life over the past year.  I'm not completely over my suicidal feelings, as evidenced by me contemplating suicide last night, but I feel like I've been taking steps in the right direction."
588,Always feel like eventually I'll commit suicide,"While I have my ups and downs emotionally, regardless of whats going on in my life I always feel like eventually I'll commit suicide. When I'm happy, its not like I think things will get better, it just feels like a welcome break from an inevitable come down where, eventually, I'll commit suicide. When I'm feeling low again, it only confirms my fears. Its as if being suicidal is my baseline, and every other feeling is just a break from the norm."

591,DAE wish you would find someone like yourself so that you feel less alone?,"I started a new job, secretly hoping to meet somebody like me. But I feel alone around people once more. No one there is as quiet and introverted and socially awkward as I am. There is no sadness in their eyes, no melancholy in their voice. Everyone seems to be confident and certain. I'm probably the only virgin at work again and it makes me feel so alone. It sucks and it's exhausting to fake your smile and confidence every day even though I feel like they can see through my facade. I just want to open up to someone at work, be vulnerable around them, knowing they won't hurt me because they feel the same. "
592,The more time passes the more i feel empty.,"i dont know if im depressed or something but i guessed that this is the place that could show me what to do, its been 4 years of this ""thing"" happening to me, first it was me being silent in school and being build everywhere to the point where i'd have thoughts of killing my class mates then after i had a series of break ups (friends and girlfriend), i started having gaint mood swings at random times and sometimes it would last days, only this year i feel like i died inside.

when ever i get anxious or just stuck in my head i go outside and smoke and feel the need to scream, but now i just want to pour a cup of whiskey and knock my self out as quick as possible, just like last night i felt a mix of like sadness or anger or something so i flipped a coin weather id cut my arm or not, the coin landed on the not side, but id be lying if i said i wasn't fully committed to do it.

i dont feel like im depressed most of the time i laugh and im kind to the people i trust, but these things happen, and have been getting progressively more common and i really dont feel like taking the label of depression becasue i feel like this is all fake and im just making it up to look cool or something."
593,[Advice] Should i give my pets a better home?,"Let me start off by saying, i'm going to seem like a total ass for making this, but please, hear me out. Sorry if this post is too long.

Recently i bought two guinea pigs, forgetting i'm extremely allergic. If i even pet them, i break out, eyes swell and my whole body itches like i'm on fire. 

And this is the part that makes me seem like an ass. I mostly keep them in the cage and hardly touch them, its not to be cruel, its just they have become aggressive and skittish due to my lack of handling. I have to take my pets everywhere because of my panic disorder, plus they help my depression, here's the thing. they can't help if i'm never with them, only guinea pigs and cats (cats don't bother me as much, i love em') cause allergic reactions for me, since i can't care for piggies properly, my mum said i should sell them to a better home, or, ask someone to trade a baby rabbit for both guinea pigs. I really really really need to have a pet with me to calm my panic or i blackout/zoneout and can't breathe, should i get rid of them and get a rabbit? They don't bother my allergies one bit, i would make sure the pigs went to a much better home than mine, i have money for a rabbit, rabbit food, bedding, and toys, i already have two perfect cages for animals, should i get the bunny and find a better home for the piggies?

Try and be understanding, but be blunt if needed. Sorry for the long post   "

My dad actually retains stuff that I say, but he isn’t the head of the house so he really can’t do anything about it. The main problem with him, is that his entire pay check goes to what he wants, because he can, when both my parents work.

My mom always talks about wanting to be supportive but also does nothing aside from helping with some project once or twice. Whenever we talk about something important it’s like she fucking forgets the next day and I just feel like there’s no point in asking for anything now. She can’t even schedule a doctors appointment so I can talk about my ADD and concerns about having no motivation. I feel like every week, she says that I’m gonna have so much trouble taking care of a house on my own, and that I don’t do enough, and every time I say “okay give me more to do” and it just fucking flies by her head.

Alright, on with the post.

&gt; Be me
&gt; 18 y.o. male
&gt; Moved to new high school after junior year.
&gt; Saw cute girl.  Maybe 7 or 8/10. 
&gt; Thought, “She’s okay.  I’d be fine with dating her.”
&gt; Up until this point, and even now, I still have never gone on a date.  Not unattractive, but there are a plethora of reasons as to why, mostly psychological.
&gt; In other words, this thought means that I find her attractive, but would not actively pursue her, as I was not interested in her.  If she were to ask me out, I would accept.
&gt; Turns out she’s in band with me (different sections).
&gt; Talk to her.
&gt; Become good friends.
&gt; Spend a lot of time together through mutual classes and band.  We essentially both ran our band Senior year (she was drum major and I was center snare, percussion section leader, and de facto head of the leadership team).
&gt; Flash forward to end of Senior year.
&gt; Been friends for ~1.5 years.
&gt; Through idle thinking, I realize that I like being around her more than my best friend at my old school (who is also a girl).  This is exceptionally weird for me, as I tend to bond to people VERY slowly.  So for me to, first off, make a friend that fast and then to actually enjoy being around her more than my other friend of ~6 years is highly unusual.
&gt; Begin to question if I’m actually attracted to new friend.
&gt; I discover yes, just this past week.
&gt; This is a giant revelation to me for two reasons:
I am not very in tune with my emotions, especially the positive ones.  Attraction is the worst.  So for me to actually figure it out is quite the feat for me.
Second, I am VERY picky with who I like.  She is the 3rd person I can say with assurance that I am actually attracted to.  Remember, I’m 18.
&gt; All good news.
&gt; “But wait, OP, then why does the title say to give the longest chain of F comments known to man, until the r/teenagers hive mind dies out around comment 23?”
&gt; That’s a very good question, astute reader.  Here’s where the “fun” begins.

&gt; Girl has boyfriend.  Has had the same boyfriend since (as far as I know) before I came to this town.
&gt; He is a Marine.
&gt; Probably due to risk of deployment, he proposed at prom (April) and she said yes.
&gt; Separate note, I didn’t learn of this until mid-May.  Basically, I wasn’t at prom because I hate dances so I missed the action; I don’t have social media, besides Reddit; and everybody thought I already knew.
&gt; Anyway, this means that, by the time I figure out I like this girl (mid/late-June), she’s been engaged for quite some time.
&gt; I try and avoid thinking about it too much.
&gt; Then, yesterday, I get card from her in the mail.
&gt; Is wedding invitation.
&gt; This October.
&gt; Guess I can’t avoid it now.

Let’s hope college brings me better luck.

(I don’t think any of my friends are on Reddit, but just in case.  If you think you either know who I am or who the girl is, PM me.  I don’t want personal information revealed in the comment section.  I don’t want her to know and I also very much value my privacy/anonymity.)"
601,Lonely as usual,"I'm done. I'm so fucking done. I've reached the point where I'm begging, *BEGGING*, friends to hang out. No one ever has time when I ask and that's if they decide to reply.

Make new friends? Fuck you. Think I haven't tried that? It's like asking someone with no arms and legs to swim across lake Michigan. You just can't when you're depressed and when your self esteem is made smaller with each unresponded text or ""no"". It's not even a question of asking. It's the default answer. 

Family isn't all that helpful. Sure, they're there for me, but it's not the same. My thoughts are not in sync with theirs and we have little to nothing alike. I bond with a hobo better, despite their best intentions. I'm just... done. What I hate the most is that a year ago, it was not like this. I was engaged, happy, surrounded by people with my own place and now I'm single (cheated on), alone and living on my grandparents couch. I don't just have low self esteem; I have none left and it hurts so much. 

I'm tired of meeting new people and then never hearing from them again. I'm tired of being told I'm an awesome guy, but never asked to hang out again. I'm tired of having the label of ""great person!"" and nothing (or no one) to show for it. I'm tired of always being needed and not wanted. I'm tired of having to explain why ""my friends"" didn't go to that bbq at the park or why they haven't been around in a while. I'm so fucking tired of having to lie that I'm going out with friends and end up at the bar alone with a new story of what we did that night (a beautifully fabricated story I would wished had been true). I'm tired of being ostracized by all my friends because I was cheated on. That makes no God damned sense. Why exclude me when I need them most? I'm tired sitting in the car for half an hour after work for no reason wondering whether I should go home or lie about hanging out. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm just so tired of it all and it feels like a knife through my heart. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm stuck and lost and being led on by false hopes of new friends everywhere I go. I just want the pain to stop. I want to go on. I WANT to be strong, but at what cost? This is no easy pain to deal with and I'm tired of begging or hoping. I'm tired of having to close my eyes and imagine myself in a happy scenario because despite my best efforts, I can't seem to find myself in one. I'm just... tired and exhausted.

All I wanted in the last couple months is someone to hold and just cry out my pain. I can't even get a fucking text. Want to know how many people I texted in the last week? 23. Twenty three. They all said the exact same message. ""Hello!"" None replied. None. Zero. Zilch. The only person who did was my best friend. Two days later. Who lives in the middle of no where Alaska. A simple hello. What am I supposed to feel? It'll be done in time? You'll pass through this hill? This isn't a hill anymore. It's a steel wall and I can't get past it. 

End of the line. I hope I don't wake up tomorrow but knowing my luck, I probably will. This is my fourth attempt (my last one was in July). I'll see you all on the other side. Maybe. Odds are, I'll wake up in the hospital again. "

603,I’ve officially worried my school.,"My HS doesn’t do video conferences, we are literally given a handful of videos and assignments on canvas. Meaning you can do it when ever you want to at kinda your own pace. It also means you have to log the hours your working on it.


Im naturally an insomniac and i work better at night so now they logs of me working at 12-5am 
 And one day i fell asleep mid video and forgot i was still on the clock so it showed i worked for almost 40 hours."
604,I'm so anxious and scared and nervous.,"I want to kill myself everyday but I'm too afraid of there being nothing after. I wish I could talk to my boyfriend more but he has school and work and I feel distant. I wish I had more people I consider to be friends to talk to. I wish I had better parents. I wish I didn't have to worry about being falsely accused by my step sister of being a pedophile as she did to my brother. I wish my mother wasn't abusive towards me or my brother. I wish I liked myself. I wish I wasn't me. I hate everything with my current circumstance. I wish I could just curl up and cry. I wish I could cry without being shamed for it. I don't want to be here anymore. No, I'm not saying I'm killing myself, Im saying I can't handle it anymore."

606,My job is highly confrontational and it makes me sad/want to die,"My job involves auditing the processes of very high level people and then having to deliver challenging news to them.  Sometimes the higher-ups in my department will let mid-level people like me ""take the heat"" on these things (i.e., if a VP is upset about something in a meeting, my leadership will ""abandon ship"" and considerably soften the message to gain more approval from the VP, leaving me as the ""bad guy"" who delivered more critical information, if that makes sense).  

Anyway, I don't want to get into details because it's too specific and technical, but in a meeting today, I felt humiliated and started crying (in a covert way, but since there were only 4 people there, it may have been noticed).  It was traumatic for me because the VP attacked my points and basically mocked my word choice, how I spoke, etc.  I feel very sad.  I must stay at this job at least 2 more months, so unfortunately quitting is not currently an option.  It may seem illogical, but killing myself seems like it would bring more relief than quitting anyway.  I just wish somehow the VP who attacked me would have tried to listen to me and not jumped to conclusions or tried to undermine me.  It just makes me so sad when people feel the need to do that.  "

611,I have failed. I'm now a failure. There's no more hope.,"For the past 3 years, I've been in 2 years of A-Levels and 1 year of first year university.

During the first 2 years I worked my ass off studying. Hoping that I could get into a top university. That would mean I'm successful. That would mean I'm worth something. Something to show for myself.

I laboured greatly to create a product design portfolio.

Parents tell me they won't pay to send me to study product design at that university, AFTER I've stressed and worked so hard to create a portfolio, and AFTER I got an offer.

&amp;nbsp;

I do the A-Levels.

Get great results. Better than I expected but I didn't apply to any top universities that I can afford. Because my parents tell me they won't pay for the engineering university that I got into.

I apply to top universities that I can afford.

Start first year engineering in a mediocre uni while I wait for the result outcome.

Today the results outcome has been given to me.

&amp;nbsp;

The top university rejected me.

For the past year I've just been holding out hope but that's gone now. I'm stuck here. I've nowhere to go from here.


Yeah whatever top universities don't mean anything, just fuck off. This is what I've been working towards. This has been my goal. This has been the achievement that would have meant the most to me. BUt I failed and I'm worthless and I'm less than anyone around me.

I don't have anything. I don't have many good friends, I don't have a girlfriend and I never have. My grades are slipping. Because what's the point. I got the second highest possible GPA last semester but nobdoy fuckign cares and rightfully so, because they're meaningless.

ffs I just need to cry and let this shit out. I just need somebody to talk to. I have nobody. I don't have anyone to listen. I don't have a shoulder to cry on, someone to comfort me. I'm so lonely.

If I slit my throat tonight, nobody will find out about it until weeks later.

nobody is going to fucking read this anyway because nobody cares.

I really don't think any assignment should take more than a few hours, and maybe that's a flawed thinking..."

624,Emptiness and self-loathing… Makes me wanna die now.,"Why do hearts and brains feel empty? You know they aren’t. They’re filled with a lot. There’s things there, you know it. You can see the things, hear the things. But you just… Just can’t feel them. You act like you do, cause you want to, right? You wanna feel it. But you can’t. Doesn’t matter how hard you try. So you just put on a stupid mask. Why? Easy reason. Telling someone you know and love that you’re this down is like putting a freaking gun to their head. I’m letting everyone down. I feel like a weight destined to crush people. I’m supposed to be happy. Why would I be depressed? I literally have no reason. I’m jealous of other people’s problems. If I actually had a problem or reason, I could have more “empathy”, “understanding” or something for myself. I only find myself… Ummm I don’t know. I guess I just HATE MYSELF. For BEING THIS WAY. It makes me ANGRY. I end up just telling myself, hey, stupid, I wanna let you know you’re a freaking idiot for thinking that way. Go die. It makes me wanna die more than anything. The world wouldn’t miss me. I usually tell myself ugghh… I have to live tomorrow. I recently had a new thought… Seeing my freaking 30th birthday cake. That seems… bizarre. 30??!! That’s… That’s a long ways away… It makes me cry. I have to suffer for THAT LOOONNG??!!! I’m freaking 18!!!!! I haven’t even “started” life yet!! Heh… Im…. Im already “done”… Im such a… a… Im so “weak”? If that’s the word? Other people live their WHOLE LIVES without one thought of wanting to kill themselves. That makes me feel… sooo alone. I wish I was never born. I don’t wanna be here. I see no future. Yet… here I am? In existence? I’m freaking tired of typing this long rant. You’re probably thinking of telling me to just freaking shut up and deal with it. I kinda wanna go die now. Bye."

626,[Discussion] Fun Things to do in the Winter?,"It is almost winter and my girlfriend and I dated in the summer and did fun summer things like swim and go to six flags and such.

630,I'm so regretful right now.,"So the story starts with a girl named A. I had a crush on A last year and it turned out she didn't like relationships. My crushing didn't faint and eventually, this year, I began dating A. We dated for about 3 months and decided our personalities clashed too much and we would be better off as friends (also college coming up in a few weeks). We try it, but eventually begin hooking up again and call ourselves ""friends with benefits."" That's been going on for about 2 weeks now, and I fucked her last week on like Wednesday. Anyways, tonight, I was pretty drunk and this girl, well call her L, hits me up and wants to fuck. Me being drunk n horny, I say ok n she comes over n I fuck her. Now I'm laying here at 3 am feeling so regretful bc I don't like L at all and feel like, even though we're not dating, I just cheated on A. What do I do?

Then it got a little longer and a little heavier and coping took more focus, more control. At 36 i have no freindships or attachments and i don't know why.

My mother did not teach me to be a functional adult and my dad wasn’t really a lot in my life to teach me to adult.

I’m in college right now, my exams are right after my birthday. I’m not grasping the stuff I have to learn, because I made stupid mistakes. Trying to be happy again by doing stuff that would destract me.(going out with people, watching movies)

I’m freaking out I’ve got no clue what I’m doing and the way my body deals with stress and negative emotions is to just stop feeling anything and it scares me so much. 

Besides my mom recently contacted me again after a few months, I really don’t want to talk to her. 
We had a big fight last year, were she threatened to throw me out of the house(she had done that many times before, saying I don’t deserve to live with her because I don’t love her enough) and I just had enough and left to live with my dad.

I thought moving in with my dad would help me feel more like an actual human, but I still feel stressed and everything is just adding up and I just don’t want to exist anymore. Like no more saddens, loneliness and feeling like I don’t deserve to even be on the earth.

I feel like a failure, I don’t want to be that, I really don’t. But all my mistakes have caught on, and now I have to lay in it, I know.  I just needed to put my thoughts somewhere, otherwise I would really go mad."

I want company so badly, but since I don't have the energy/motivation nor the intelligence to go about getting it, I'm just stuck feeling an overwhelming sense of loneliness.

676,Please read this if you're considering losing your v card.,"First of all I'm 15 and bi, and I lost my virginity when I was 12. (not even 12 actually, had like a month for my bday) it was with a very close male friend. It was fun, it was nice, it felt good etc.  Time went by, we kept having sex regularly for 1.5+ years, and then I had to move into another city. The problem is, *most* kids around that age  wouldn't be able to talk about such a thing, even in a relationship. Having sex and talking about is not a thing alot of  teens can handle. I WANTED to talk to him about this, what it meant, how we'd stay friends (with benefits of course) and it wouldn't go far. Of course he didn't want to talk about it, he flat out refused. When I moved into izmir, we only could chat through discord/ play games together etc, y'know the usual stuff. But that awkward feeling never went away. It still is there, after three years. If I could just go back three years, i definitely wouldn't have had sex with him. In my opinion, sex is a responsibility. You have to be emotionally equipped to handle it. Even I wasn't *that* prepared about it.  When you look back, it feels weird. Yes, it might be a cool thing to brag about in friend groups and shit but I feel like I wasted it. Because I didn't know what it meant.  Back then I considered it to be nothing spectacular, but it was. It always will be.  Yes it might've been good, but that doesn't change the fact that it meant absolutely nothing to me.  

Sorry for really shitty grammar and formatting. I'm on mobile and it's almost 4 AM."
677,Loving someone with depression.,"Hello dear reditors! 
This is my first time posting on reddit and I do not know what to do with my current situation. I have met my girlfriend 6 months ago and we have been dating since.  It may sound cheesy but she means everything to me and i’m willing go through anything even it meant for me to take a toll on myself.

We are couples in our early 20’s , my girlfriend has depression, and she is scared that her depression is affecting our relationship, 

At first, it was difficult to deal with my relationship because it was my first time dealing with someone with depression, and  I would take some of the things that she does or says personally or I would try to fix her. As time passed I tried to learn about depression to really understand where was she coming from, and it really helped. For example, i should think of depression as different entity that are completely separate from her, thus I was able to learn to not take it personally. Also I tried stopped fixing her, because I understood nothing can get her out of depression but herself, but we as SO should be able to support them when they are in need. I have learned to put my ego aside and really love her unconditionally. 

However, no matter how well Informed or how well I thought I started coping with her depression, it takes emotional toll on me, I realized yesterday that I am not as supportive  as I believed to be in myself. For instance, when she was giving me attitude the other day, instead of waiting out patiently to cool her down, i left the room clearly indicating my anger in which she would not reach me halfway when I was clearly reaching out to her by trying to talk and apologize.

I just wish sometimes she would tell me what to do, instead of just packing her stuff to go home just saying i dont feel good i wanna go home.  I try to control my temper as much as possible and Sometimes I just walk out on her, believing it is the best thing since I tend to worsen the situation when I get angry or frustrated. When I came back, she was waiting in my room to talk about how me walking out hurt her and it was not my first, ( so scary that i only realized it yesterday when she pointed out to me) . 

I do not know why I’m writing this, but I just can not hold this thoughts within myself and I have learned a lot from you guys on reddit, advice or kind words would really help. 

In short, she loves me and she appreciates me as much as I love her and never In my life i was this sure that I want to spend the rest of my life with this girl no matter of the circumstances. 

Most importantly, I think we need to be very aware of our own behavior and attitude , because we tend to learn to put blame on depression unconsciously, since both of you start to believe that is the root of every one of your fights. but we have to acknowledge that every couples fight, healthy or not and it is important to learn to find the wrong in you first before pointing your finger to a very thing that is fighting continuously within your loved ones.

Heh heh... ya just fell into my trap card kiddo"
683,So i went to see NWH with some buddies (no spoilers in the post dw),So this was my first time after like 2 years interacting with people irl. Today my friend's father rang me up and asked me i was going with the bois (i wasnt invited) and i said  no. he asked me to go so i talked to my mom about it called up one guy and made him book a ticket for me as well. we got together in the mall chatted and ran into my classmates (who also grouped up to watch NWH and hadnt invited me). They all sat in the D-row(higher in the seets) and i sat in the K-row(middle seats because my ticket was booked like 3 hours before the film). in the intermission of my friends sat next to me. The movie was great i had a pleasant expirience but what bugged me a little was that the bunch of people who i went with were talking a lot amongst themselves and i wasnt able to make a continuous conversation with them. This actually kinda worries me because i am in my senior year of highschool and i am going to graduating next year and not seeing any of my high school friends anymore. the fact that they didnt invite me dosent bug me but what bugs me is that i wasnt able to make any conversation with them. **Is there any piece of advice yall would give to interact with classmates/friends normally and have a continuous conversation rather than broken one liners?**
684,My brother dropped a bombshell on me today...,"A little backstory, first. I'm 14. I just got out of a mental hospital for depression, anxiety, alcohol abuse, and suicidal thoughts. I'm on new medicine and I was feeling much better, until this afternoon.


Please stay with me. This has a point. I got home from school and was making myself some food. I had actually had a fairly good week, for once. Testing is over, and my grades are rocketing up. My brother asks to use my laptop. I say he may. I ask what he wants it for and he says he needs to print something. Now, our printer has not worked in a long time. It does not work, and he knows this. He asks if he can still try, and I say no, because it is pointless and the printer is not physically capable of printing. He keeps insisting on using it and tells me I'm being selfish, even though I'm saying he can use it, as long as he doesn't print. He is mildly irritated and begins to pout. I offer to make him food, he refuses. I offer to try and find another way to entertain him, he refuses. I was trying really hard to be nice, because I had had a great day.


10 minutes or so pass and he's mostly over it. He's still begging, but not mad. He's finishing homework and accidentally cut himself on something. He asked me to help him get something to help. I say that I really can't because the medicine cabinet is locked.
He looks at me and says the most hurtful words I've ever fucking heard, *""God. I can't even go into the cabinet to get a Band-Aid and it's all because of you.""*


I just stood there in shock. He is 11, but he knows what I'm going through. He was talked to about how serious my condition was and to be careful of what is said. He knows that my parents now keep the medicine cabinet locked because I may kill myself. He knows I was in a hospital. He knows it all and still said that to me. In those few seconds, I went from having a great few days, to terrible. My own brother said this to me.


He doesn't give a shit that I want to die so long as he gets a Band-Aid. On top of all this, it is the weekend of my motherfucking BIRTHDAY. Not only did he want to hurt me so much over a cabinet lock, he decided the weekend of my birthday, a month after I was released from a hospital, would be a good time.


He hasn't even apologized once, either. I just stared at him with an open-mouthed stare of disbelief, anger, sadness, and betrayal. He doesn't care at all. He's always been very self-centered, but this was just kicking me in the groin. I feel like utter shit. I'm not allowed to take an Aspirin by myself because I may chug the whole bottle and he sees this as fair game. It's now 5 in the morning, the day before my birthday, and I don't feel any happiness at all.


Happy fucking birthday to me, I guess."

### ""All religions are true but none are literal.""

Bill Moyers: But I can hear someone saying, ""Well, that's all well and good for the imagination of a George Lucas or for the scholarship of a Joseph Campbell, but that isn't what happens in my life.""

Joseph Campbell: You bet it is -- and if he doesn't recognize it, it may turn him into Darth Vader. **If the person insists on a certain program, and doesn't listen to the demands of his own heart, he's going to risk a schizophrenic crackup. Such a person has put himself off center.** He has aligned himself with a program for life, and it's not the one the body's interested in at all. The world is full of people who have stopped listening to themselves or have listened only to their neighbors to learn what they ought to do, how they ought to behave, and what the values are that they should be living for. 

=========================

-------------

=========================

Discussing the story of Tristan and Isolde, written around the year 1180.

Joseph Campbell: But there's danger, too, of course. In the Tristan romance, when the young couple has drunk their love potion and Isolde's nurse realizes what has happened, she goes to Tristan and says, ""You have drunk your death."" And **Tristan says, ""By my death, do you mean this pain of love?"" -- because that was one of the main points, that one should feel the sickness of love.** There's no possible fulfillment in this world of that identity one is experiencing. Tristan says, ""If by my death, you mean this agony of love, that is my life. If by my death, you mean the punishment that we are to suffer if discovered, I accept that. And if by my death, you mean eternal punishment in the fires of hell, I accept that, too."" Now, that's big stuff.

Bill MOYERS: Especially for medieval Catholics, who believed in a literal hell. So what's the significance of what Tristan was saying?

Joseph CAMPBELL:  **What he was saying is that his love is bigger even than death and pain, than anything. This is the affirmation of the pain of life in a big way.**

=========================================

=========================================

""I had a friend who attended an international meeting of the Roman Catholic meditative orders, which was held in Bangkok. He told me that the Catholic monks had no problems understanding the Buddhist monks, but that it was the clergy of the two religions who were unable to understand each other.""

""The person who has had a mystical experience knows that **all the symbolic expressions of it are faulty.** The symbols don't render the experience, they suggest it. If you haven't had the experience, how can you know what it is? Try to explain the joy of skiing to somebody living in the tropics who has never even seen snow. **There has to be an experience to catch the message, some clue -- otherwise you're not hearing what is being said.**""  (Joseph Campbell)

=================================

-------------

=================================

Bill MOYERS: But people ask, **isn't a myth a lie**?

Joseph CAMPBELL: No, mythology is not a lie, **mythology is poetry, it is metaphorical. It has been well said that mythology is the penultimate truth -- penultimate because the ultimate cannot be put into words.** It is beyond words, beyond images, beyond that bounding rim of the Buddhist Wheel of Becoming. Mythology pitches the mind beyond that rim, to what can be known but not told. So this is the penultimate truth.

**It's important to live life with the experience, and therefore the knowledge, of its mystery and of your own mystery. This gives life a new radiance, a new harmony, a new splendor. Thinking in mythological terms helps to put you in accord with the inevitables of this vale of tears.** *You learn to recognize the positive values in what appear to be the negative moments and aspects of your life.* The big question is whether you are going to be able to say a hearty yes to your adventure.

Bill MOYERS: The adventure of the hero?

Joseph CAMPBELL: Yes, the adventure of the hero -- the adventure of being alive.

## Joseph Campbell (1904-1987)

You can read more of his interviews [here](http://www.jungland.ru/Library/CampMoye.htm)

**American professor, writer, scholar** and orator in the fields of mythology and **comparative religion**. He passionately studied myth and its similar, seemingly cohesive threads among all human cultures, ie that all myths originate from a common source - the communal past of the human race. He believed all the religions of the world, all the rituals and deities, to be “masks” of the same transcendent truth which is “unknowable.” He often quoted a Vedic Scripture saying, ""Truth is one, the sages speak of it by many names"".

695,I want to die,"I was sitting with my friend at lunch, and I put my hand on her shoulder. She then literally shrugged it off and I had a panic attack because I think she now thinks it was an advance on her, but I could be overthinking it because she was still talking to me afterwards, but maybe not? I don’t know I panicked!

As of now I think she was just trying to be funny and I didn’t get it (mainly because the reason I put my hand on her was because I was sort of being condescending because she thinks that a single piece of macaroni is called a “macaroninis”)"
696,I hit a car in the parking lot,"Ok it wasn't that bad but I'm like 5'5 and my dad decides to teach me how to drive today, but he has a big SUV and I can't see the front of the car or the road, he didn't show me how to move up the seat which apparently is a thing. I was driving in a parking lot with an island in the middle and he made me park it in the space next to the car that was parked in the island after we were done. I told him I couldn't and that we should leave but he told me to do it anyway and I dinged the car because I pressed gas instead of brake. The car is fine and I'm fine but I don't think I'm getting my license cuz I literally could not see where the end of my car was or where the lines below are. I hope you enjoyed my story and feel free to leave any funny/unfortunate first time driving stories down below."
697,I don't even think I feel human anymore.,"My parents have refused to go back on what they said earlier. They said if I did a zoom call with the head of some program that they would pay for meds and doctors appointments and turn the wifi back on. I spoke with the dude and I didn't like the program, the location it was in, and the rules the dude said they have there. 


My parents refuse to believe that my reasons for not wanting to go are valid. They keep asking for access to my therapist but my next appointment isn't for another week and my therapist hasn't emailed me back yet. 





I haven't been able to talk to someone in days. I can't talk to my friends on Discord or play games with them. I don't have any IRL friends at all. I would use some of the money I have to at least get a coffee and sit at a coffee shop for a bit but I only have $17 and that's not even enough to buy a refill of my medications when they run out on a week or two.


I've listed a few of my Lego sets for sale but I haven't had anyone contact me about them yet. 




I thought I was getting close. I was making progress, not much, but more progress then I've made in the last year and now I'm back to where all I can think about is suicide.



I just wish I wouldn't wake up tomorrow. I just want to rest. I don't want to go through anything anymore. I've already feel like an old man with how much I've gone through and I'm only 22. I can't do another 10 or 20 years of this."

It's not due to it being small, quite the opposite infact.

It's ruining my life and people seem to think I'm wrong and it's a gift.

The past week however, has been numb. My anxiety flares up for no apparent reason. I'll wake up sweating short of breath and anxious all day. I thought I had finally beat the demons in my head. I thought I made them go quiet but I guess I just will never be alone, never have any peace.

This morning I didn't go to work. I called my boss, explained what was happening. I got the day off, but that's not what I want. Now I just feel miserable and I just feel like a dud. A cardboard cutout in my shape and size. Worst of all I just can't let my wife down. How is she and my infant going to eat. I gotta pay rent, but I can't even breath. I need someone to erase the mistake that I am.

I'm sure all of you have heard the same shit I heard when I was young about how childhood is gonna be the best part of your life and blah blah work sucks, but just know it doesn't have to be like that.  I was a very sad child and never knew how to handle emotions, i was not poor or in a broken home but had religion shoved down my throat since i was in the womb and was also raised in very hateful environment with divorced parents, maybe this matters, maybe it doesn't.

This past year has been very hard for me mentally and for the first 1/4 of this year all I could think about was the state of the world and how strange of a time i grew up in, and the saddest part is the clear image that things are not really getting better, recently it struck me how strange it must be for people in the generation below me, as strange as my upbringing was and separating right from wrong, you guys have it a lot worse.  Just understand that this will be your guys world, and while I can't say im happy with the one's were handing to you, i can say that everyone reading this has the ability to put fourth effort to create a happy place to live."

There is so much beauty in the world
 And I just wanted to see

Anything to tame the chest on fire. 
something to justify an warm life


The world ends today and I'll be dancing
The world ends today and I'll be dancing
The world ends today and I'll be dancing with you

(""Dançando"" Written by Pitty)


This song has spoken to me all day long. I've been thinking, what if my world ends today, or tomorrow, will i die before i see the beautiful in the smallest things?

Worse than death is a life wasted.


A lot of people comes and goes in silence, they dont make any difference. They Pass the life looking and touching their phones,more than they look and touch their wife and husband.

They live justifying with empty reasons their terrible life,their terrible routine, their terrible haircut and fancy clothes
making plans for enjoy their life they are too old to get off their beds.

Oh if they know that there's thief called ""time"" that make jokes and smiles, while he takes the best of you. He decives you, making you belive that he will be always by your side, that will always be a new day to do the thing you would like to do.

With sadness in my heart i have to admit I'm one of them... That's one, among many  reasons for my depression: I dont want to live an ordinary life.

I want to feel the fire of the most strong love, i want to cry and laugh,i want to help,i want to understand why am i here! 

I want to get off this shit called ""my life"". And i don't want they find me with open wrists in the kitchen floor...
I dont want to die alone, young and sad... But i dont accept the life i'm living.

I want to be happy, if there's a god that judges me worthy allow me please find the meaning in this life. I'm tired and lonely.

I’m just there having no idea wth they’re saying and it really makes me feel like I should get tiktok...but I really don’t want to either because it seems too addictive and quite pointless (also how it’s not safe for your privacy). 

Also I casually mentioned how the government banning tiktok might be beneficial and they all looked at me with horror...

Time to get new friends maybe? Does anyone else have this problem?"
720,Do you think it is fair that I spoil Endgame for someone that spoiled it for me first?,"So basically I avoided youtube, reddit, etc, altogether to avoid seeing any spoiler, but in the end, I still got spoiled because a friend posted a spoiler to the FUCKING GROUP CHAT because he got spoiled and he wanted everyone else to feel his pain and then surprised that I got mad. Although the detail I'm about to spoil him is slightly more significant than what he spoiled me."
721,Fiance leaving me,"My fiance thinks I've hurt him, which in reality means I have. I just didn't realize I was hurting him until it was too late. The whole incident took less than 24 hours. He said that he doesn't know if we could get past this or if he ever wants to talk to me again. We've been together six years. We have children. The reason I am still alive right now is my family. But all the adults in it look at me with disgust and distrust over this. I even brought up to him that I have never lied to him before, why would I start now.  The hotline was helpful, told me to give him time and space. But he's never felt like this with me before and everyone keeps looking at me like they hate me.  I can't eat or sleep.

723,I have a substitute teacher in every single class I have today,What is going on
724,Talking to people is hard,"I have a friend. I want to talk to them. I mean at this point I just want to talk to someone. Someone other than a random person on Reddit.

I think ""I really need to talk to them"" probably at least once a week, since maybe January. They know that my mental health isn't great, but I haven't really told them much at all. The only reason I told them anything to begin with was because I basically dropped almost completely offline for about 2 weeks in January, so I felt I had to at least give them some explanation, and I thought the ""personal reasons"" bullshit I gave to everyone else wasn't enough with them.

Every time I try to talk, something stops me. Sometimes they send me a message so we end up in our normal, somewhat cheery conversation tone, and i think its weird to just completely change the tone for no reason. Other times I get super close but I just can't bring myself to send the message. Probably one of the biggest reasons why is because I honestly have no idea *how* to do it.

Like how the fuck do you tell someone that you're genuinely considering suicide? When the vast majority of the time you're a cheery dude, when you've never told anyone something like this before, when you barely even communicate in the first place?

So far when I've actually managed to compose a message, I've ended up with a super long fucking essay that is just me pouring my heart out trying to explain how I feel. With a single long message I can shoot it off, and basically go offline for a while before I'm ready to look at the response. but I don't know if I want to just tell someone or if I want a conversation. I don't know.

I mean I've always had a problem with communication. I'm kind of an introvert. Ok I'm very introverted. I can talk to people just fine, for a while. After a certain amount of time, it's like a switch just flips and I suddenly don't want to be there. I want to be alone. But when I am alone, I kind of wish it lasted longer.

It probably doesn't help that most of the friends I've had haven't actually felt like friends. People don't usually want to talk to me specifically, they're just not against me being there. 

I'm also not super close with my family. I mean we're not on bad terms, but I find talking with them exhausting. Most of the time I talk to my parents, the conversation always ends up with them talking about something super serious to do with my future, or it's about how I need to take better care of myself or I'll have all kinds of issues when I'm older. It probably doesn't help that I don't care because I believe I'll kill myself kind of soon. I know next to nothing about my brother beyond what uni course he did. We don't talk unless we have to.

There's some mental health support stuff available at my uni. But I don't think I could ever do something like that. The problem I have is that id be talking to someone I don't know, who would be able to easily identify me. Like I'm ok sharing some personal feelings on Reddit because no one knows me. I get uncomfortable when people know who I am and very personal stuff about me. I also have heard bad things, like someone reached out only to be ignored in the future, and I think something like that might push me over the edge.

I feel alone. Everyone has someone they care about and someone who cares about them. I have like 3 friends who I barely talk to and don't feel comfortable opening up to."

729,I told my mum and she was not happy,"I recently found out I don't just have depression. I have dysthymia, bipolar depression, and anxiety. A few days from now I'll be meeting a psychologist that was sent to school. I told my mum firstly about this and she asked, ""why?""

Now I'm not a person who's great at talking, but I think I didn't tell her correctly because she lashed out on me. I started off saying that I needed to see a psychologist and told them I have bipolar and dysthymia. She said it's because I'm always in front of a computer and not helping her at anything \(i hate chores :c\). I said if they \- the psychologists \-had told me to quickly go to psychiatrist and go for an antidepressant, it'd be better. But they were mad.

""Don't put our family to shame, you moron,"" my mum said to me. I just bluntly say ""OK,"" and walked away feeling defeated. That was a few minutes ago.

I regret telling her I was depressed."
730,I hate being alive (a PTSD rant),"I hate being alive. I only do it because I believe that suicide is selfish (So many people love me, plus I have minor children to raise and support).

Have you very narrowly avoided being in a bad car accident? Have you ever been super afraid of heights, and then visited the top of the Empire State Building? You know how your heart races and you shake for a few moments after? I feel like that ALL THE TIME because PTSD. I haven't had my pulse taken with a result under 90 BPM in years. Then again, I've never had my pulse taken while drunk, which is the only time I don't feel panic.

Yes, I have been to the doctors. No, they can't help me without drugs that are even worse than alcohol if taken regularly.

I do hope that I get at least a year of being retired and drinking as much as I wish before the end.

I only wish my family understood why I drink so much. They have such high hopes of me getting sober. It ain't going to happen. Getting drunk every evening is the only thing that makes life tolerable enough to not to do the deed."
731,I Ok Boomered my teacher,"So basically we were studying a poem called ""Television"" by Roald Dahl in English Class. It's a poem about how Television is harmful for kids and they should rather read books instead.

The entire class laughed and the teacher just sat in her chair with a puzzled and confused look. 







































































I failed English. Please help."
732,[discussion] about makeup,"I saw that cringey post about makeup from a few hours ago, and now I have some questions. 

First off, let me say that anybody is free to do whatever they please. I don't agree with that that other guy said at all. I'm a sucker for pretty eyes, I fall in love with any girl that wears that long-eyelash stuff. 

So, I understand that the goal is to be pretty. Which is fine. But, in theory, wouldn't it be better to spread a message of confidence in yourself, the way you are?  
I understand that some girls (or guys) do it to please themselves, and become more confident. But I feel like a better approach would be to learn to be confident as-it. Or am I completely missing something?

i speak to none of my family ( my dads side is super southern baptist... long story) and my mom married a drunk homeless man when i was 18 and kicked me out

no one cares that i finished school with honors. or went on to college although i dropped out after 3 years. 

ive done so many things to ruin my own future in youth with out realizing why i did it or the real repercussions.

i just wish i could be happy. i wish i felt therapy helped but nothing fixes it. my father didnt care enough to live for me or hurt so much nothing could help. my mother cast me aside easily for men. my mema who i love dearly is wheelchair bound at my mothers. i miss her so much. 

i just wish i believed it gets better. "

Well, at around 4 am I decided to recheck my schedule AND WE GOT FUCKING CLASS AT 9 AM

So now it's 6 am and trying my best to fight sleep to not skip class

Also that 9 am class is separate from my other classes 

Each day has 2 classes, this teacher decided to reschedule to today at 9 am which means I now have 3 classes on this day (but 1 on the day this teacher is supposed to teach at) 

So now, either I attend this 9 am class and then sleep and hope to God I wake up on time for my afternoon classes or tough it out until it's all finished and sleep at 6-7 pm

740,A small inconsequential drop in the ocean.,"I started reading a few of the post in /r/depression lately, and I've found that I feel the same way a lot of the people here do. Sadly while reading, I didn't find anything that helped me, just people saying how they felt the same at some time excluding if they still do or not. It ended up making me feel very alone and got me thinking about how small and meaningless me life really is.

I'm still very young, only 18. I finished high school the past year, barely graduating. I've never had a girlfriend, or even heard through the grapevine of a girl liking me. I have never kept a ""friend"" for more then a few years. I have been becoming more and more apathetic to everything around me. I can't remember the last time that I felt anything except being unneeded. I have been trying to find a job (at least 1 application a day) and have still been unable to get even a few callbacks. I'm not artistic or creative. I've never done anything that won a prize, or even got enough praise to feel like it actually was good or different. 

Pretty much I just feel like I am a small drop in the ocean, and unneeded. I have started writing my thoughts down at the end of each day, and I don't feel that it is helping or hurting at all. I don't have the money for an real medical assistance, and I don't have a friend or anyone that I feel I can turn to and talk to. I figured that I should at least try reddit and see if you guys can help me at all. 

Sorry for the long post."

I don't have the motivation to get up and go to the gym. Right now I want to go walk the track even just to get out, its sunny (but freezing!) outside, so even the walk to the vehicle and back would give me some sunshine.

I checked my calendar and at 1:00 I have to leave to drop some paperwork off, so I will dress for the gym and stop on the way back and walk the track for at least 15 minutes.  I will try for a half hour but I want to set a smaller goal so I can feel good about meeting that goal, and better if I surpass it.

744,I'm ending my life in a few days and it feels amazing," M15 here. I've never felt peace like this before. Even if all my relationships are crumbling to the ground, I'm fine with it. For the first time in 5 years, I'm happy. Happy because I know it'll all be over soon and I can rest.

I know the comments will tell me not to do it, but I've tried everything: suicide hotline, school counselor, therapist (though only once), talking to loved ones, and talking to strangers on Reddit.

Suicide hotline was not helpful at all, therapist and counselor just doesn't feel natural, talking to loved ones scares them too much, and talking to strangers on Reddit has worked somewhat, but all of them believe I'm an attention seeking teenager now, and I won't blame them for it. I hope they're happy to know I'll be leaving soon.

The countdown is 4 days. 4 days until I feel peace. I have finished my goodbye notes to some friends, and I plan on finishing that tonight and tomorrow. The next day I will write my family goodbye notes, and I will write my overall goodbye note on the day I die. I have to write to 50+ people so I'll be busy (I'm a generally loved person sadly)

So yeah, just wanted to share that here. I'm beyond happy now, but I want anyone reading this to know suicide is not worth it. You have so much to live for, please do not do it. It's just- I don't see those same reasons applied to me. I'm the ONE exception.

Alright Reddit, I'll be here for the next 4 days. Talk to me, ask me something, whatever you want."
745,okay.... so.... fuck.,"im not trying to get your attention, but if you decided to read this, ill be pretty happy.

So, since my childhood, all dreams and mostly of them, nightmares, had some real impact on the world outside of dreams.

Never really cared, because I often don't dream anything, and im not irritated by nightmares. But fuck this shit. I got the same nightmare three times in a row during this one night. And it was catching my girlfriend cheating. I saw how she enjoyed each kiss with the other dude, everything. In first dream, she tried apologizing, in second she didn't really cared about it, and in third she just dumped me.

Problem is, as I already mentioned before, dreams have some impact related to things I dreamed about. Im already insecure about lots of shit, and always worrying about my girlfriend. Worst thing is that I can't even talk to her yet, because shes happily sleeping. And I have no idea what to do. It just hurt so fucking much to see her enjoy all the kisses like they meant nothing to her. Even if it was a dream, im scared for everything now."

750,Happy Birthday Minecraft,"I remember that faithful day, it was 2012 , I had played Minecraft for about a year already, Pocket Edition, and learned that I can play it on my Computer. I went to my sister and asked her to sign me up for the free trial, she did! As soon as I loaded in my first world, “New World” and had explored for hours, trying to build with right click, on a MacBook Trackpad, I found it really confusing, but I loved it and asked my sister if I could get it, and she was so nice as to get it for me! A little while later, I migrated back to Pocket Edition and built the best thing I’d ever built with my childhood friend, we had built a tree house in creative, it had a glass viewing room, a library, even a roller coaster. It wasn’t much but we were so proud, and we were only 6-7. I remember joining servers on my Mac, I was better than my friends at technology, I could confidently find my way around stuff, and I joined mineplex (i think) and played on it for so long, I had so much fun doing everything! Not too long later, I started visiting my sisters boyfriend with her, mostly to play Minecraft on his Xbox 360 and to play with his dog. The 360 was the first full-hand controller based console I played on (I had a Wii) and it was so good, years later, he’s moved in and given it to me! Now I’ve got a Nintendo switch (wanted portability the Xbox one couldn’t give) and have been playing Minecraft so much on it!

Happy Birthday Minecraft."

Took 30 tablets for aspirin, puked for an entire day and spent the next 3 days in the hospital. Too many psych evals for me to remember. Then they put me on meds. That only made things worse. Started lashing out at people, my parents, my friends. Quit going to church after that. If I'm going to become this, this parasite, living off my parents my whole life, no. I won't let that happen.

He's really quiet and doesn't socialize much, and we have actually never hung out in person, but we talk constantly though text nd facebook. He says if we ever met in person he would be quiet though. A few months ago he seemed really upset and said he wanted to shoot up a church and then kill himself and I was worried he would, but luckily he didn't. I have no idea what to say or do to help him. I suggested antidepressants but he says he's tried those. I care about him a lot, is there anything /I could do to help my friend? I just want him to be happy."

795,If you’re thinking of ending it please read.,"I tried to commit suicide almost 3 years ago. My heart wasn’t beating for a few minutes and I narrowly missed brain damage. After I woke up and recovered I never felt a sense of regret. For 2 years I wished it worked. Life didn’t seem to be getting better. I was working hard. I was exercising, doing therapy, and medication but nothing worked. Even after barely one survival I still came very close to going through with it again. 

For the last year though, things had slowly gotten better. Now they are better to the point where I have really come to the conclusion that was the biggest mistake in my life. It didn’t happen overnight. It took a lot more suffering. But now I’m at the point where there’s enough light I can see my feet walking. 

One end of the tunnel is dark. As you head down it, it becomes more and more dark. Until eventually there is nothing left. The other end of the tunnel is filled with light and becomes brighter and brighter. Until eventually we don’t know happens. 

When we are born into our lives we are each given unique circumstances. We are each placed at different points in the tunnel. Suffrage leads us down the dark path. Happiness leads us down the light path. 

Everyone here has walked for so long in darkness you have forgotten there is a light side to the tunnel. You can’t see it anymore, don’t believe it exists. I did, I kept stumbling backwards and backwards as life hit me. I didn’t know how to walk, I didn’t know how to control my life. I fell off the end of the dark path but was able to come back. 

For 2 years I stumbled forward and I stumbled backward. Many times I came close to stumbling backward as life seemed to hit me harder. Life was hitting me in good and bad ways, making me stumble. 

I was lucky to eventually stumble far enough into the light to see the ground again. I can walk. Yes I can still see darkness behind me. I know if I take the wrong turns through this tunnel I can be right back to a dark point where I can no longer see my feet and stumble. 

I just have to continue to follow the path that leads to light now that I can finally walk. I came here hoping to make anyone who is thinking thoughts of ending it realize that it is just a state of mind and that you can get to this place of being content. Please do not do it. Learn from what I learned in the biggest mistake of my life. 

I hope the best for all of you. I hope if you read this it will help nudge you closer towards the light and I hope one day you will be able to see yourself walk and control your lives too."

Discord is mad, I've witnessed 4 people be blatantly ignored. It doesn't matter how they tried to approach teen serv. There is actual grouping in discord, no one can deny it, if you deny it, you're likely in the group. 

2 guys were just trying to contribute, one guy was doing what others were doing and they got attention but the one guy didn't get it and the last guy is crying for help and yet, jack fucking shit. 

The hypocrisy is fucking disgusting, y'all claiming to be open minded and kind but it's like the popular group in HS all over again. Fucking bullshit. 

You're kind to your own and its hard to become one of y'all.

801,Something wrong with me,"Im shit at posts like this but I kinda wanted to talk about this because I was never sure about what was wrong with me until about a month ago. Basically from what I can gather I have severe cibophobia (Fear of Food for lazy peeps) and would like to share my story so far.

For about my entire life I have always been extremely picky and its not the picky where you just hate certain things and like others. It was all over the place. I liked this one thing but not the other even if it was the same meal or dish. For some reason I always have had this ever lasting love for ramen and it has definitely started to affect my body and how well it functions as it has always been my go-to meal every single day. Up until the age of 6-7, I was eating ramen for just about every meal and absolutely refused to eat anything else. My parents were extremely worried and currently still are as Im still like this but have limited myself to 2 packages a day for one meal (Which is still anything but good). As I grew older I found some newer things that I liked such as pepperoni pizza or plain sauce spaghetti but not much more than that and I was also beginning to notice that interacting with others was also becoming problematic as I had no idea why I was like this besides saying i was picky. People always try and get me to eat something but I will usually always get extremely stressed or bitchy just out of the blue, especially if they forced food near my face.

Fast forward to now. 
I have constantly dealt with this problem for all my life and would cry from time to time always becoming frustrated as to why I am the way I am. I have had other people besides my family worry about me and I have gone as far as starving myself for several days trying to get myself to become hungry enough to want something besides what I eat to make them happy or relieved. Of course to my luck it hasn’t and probably won’t work. I also don’t feel the best anymore and have had multiple vitamin deficiencies because of my dietary problems. Hell, even at one point my mother just assumed I had autism because of my problem. I had looked for any answers or sign until I was pointed into a direction that I never expected to take. My mother had a serious talk with me about a month ago and of course it was about my diet, but she then mentioned something that turned around my who perspective on this problem I have which the conversation went as so...

Mom: “Don’t you like cheese?”
Me: “No. I never hav-“
Mom: “Yes you do. [My Name] you eat pizza. Pizza has cheese which means you like cheese.”

That entire sentence sent me flying backwards in my mind rethinking just about everything I had ever tried putting together. I have no idea what lead me to look up this but when I come to think of it I always wondered why I had never looked into this before, but out of curiosity I decided to search up “Fear of food” which lead me to a google search to a website for basic knowledge on Cibophobia. Looking further into it I began to realize just about everything the website was telling me was mostly what I had been going through. Everything between liking foods that you make but not liking others food even if it was the same meal just not made by you to me gaining a social stigma when I was with others at a eat out or even my own family dinner table. 

I have brought up the matter with my mother and the rest of my family and we are planning on doing hypnotherapy as it is one of the things that is recommended for phobias like this. For once I feel like I can breathe for a sec just knowing something that actually makes sense and can explain why I have been like this. For the sake of my health I do hope that I am heading in the right direction and that I might be able to feel normal in the coming years, otherwise I will be stuck again. I want anything but to be stuck again on a roller coaster that might end my life early due to some form of organ complication.

Anyway thank you for reading all the way down here and I hope you are all having a lovely day.

P.S. If I had to describe my diet, I’d probably be better off just consuming vitamin pills and supplements along with water. Its that bad..."
802,i wish i had some ballz and a dick 😔😔😔😔😔,what does it feel.. to live MY DREAM??!!??
803,Not Urgent.,"I think about killing myself almost daily. Sometimes when I'm not even upset about anything. But, when I am upset, these thoughts are uncontrollable. I've cut myself many times, almost wreaked my car and once drank down NyQuil just so I could sleep. 

I've tried very hard to live a normal, happy life. I'm pretty popular, I have many close friends and I'm involved in greek life and other school groups. I keep good grades and I'm involved in a lot of different hobbies. In fact, most people are shocked if they do find out I'm depressed. 

I don't feel comfortable going to a doctor. Not to mention, I refuse to let my family know about my depression. 

Is there any small things I can do to help? "
804,I want to die.,"Hello. So, to start this off, I really wish you guys would try to take me seriously. I know I'm young and that I shouldn't be experiencing what I am, but it is what it is. Anyway, I'm an 11 year old boy from Brazil and recently, I've been losing control of my life so fucking much. Most of the kids in my class bully me, including my cousins. Nobody seems to want to help. I wanna open up to my friends, but they're kids, they wouldn't understand/be able to help me with my depression. Before anyone says anything, yes, I was diagnosed with it by a professional, this isn't a tumblr self diagnose. Anyway, I also feel extremely alone. I have very poor social skills, so communicating to other people is a pain. I don't have any real friends and it hurts. Whenever I see someone with a close friend or a loved one I burst into tears and can't stop staring at them, I just wanna be normal, I wanna have friends, I wanna have someone that sees me as a human, I want to feel loved. Besides all of that, I also have problems with my looks. I can't stop comparing myself to all the other boys - how pretty they are and how ugly I am in comparison, how happy they are in comparison, how much more they are than me. And my mom doesn't help either, constantly reminding myself I don't do anything but stay in my room all day. Suicide has crossed my mind so many fucking times, with the only real attempt at killing myself being at the age of 9 when I tried to stab myself in the stomach. Didn't work and only gave me a really minor wound. Recently, my only friend stopped talking with me too so it only made my suicidal thoughts come back. I'm gay but I can't come out because my entire family's christian, and If I did, the guys at school would bully me even harder. I wanna confess to one of the boys, Gabriel, that I love him, but I can't. I know he's gonna say no because of how fucking ugly I am. He's a nice guy, a really nice guy, but he's a kid and he probably values looks over personality because of that.  I just wish I wasn't that much of a pussy so I could just fucking kill myself and get this done with."

808,My life is falling apart and I can't keep going any more,"In October my first girlfriend broke up with me completely out of the blue. She was my emotional rock for the two and a half years of our relationship while I had been dealing with issues with my parents and pressures from school. I really only had one true friend at school but he had moved out at the beginning of the semester, so I really had no one to lean on for any kind of emotional support after this all went down. I pretty much stopped going to class after the breakup. Everyone who knew me kind of knew what was going on and didn't ask questions when I pretty much dropped off the face of the earth. I couldn't sleep and couldn't figure out a way to get on with my life. I was going to fail out of school because I hadn't been to any classes in a month and I couldn't bring myself to tell my parents that. I went to the counseling center on campus a couple times before Thanksgiving and was diagnosed with clinical depression and was put on Celexa over the break. It only made my depression worse and I made my plans to kill myself. 

I brought a gun back to school with me. The first night I was back I said my goodbyes to my ex on the phone. She talked me down for the night, but the next day I made plans that wouldn't fail on me. I had my jury with the brass faculty and as soon as I played I planned on walking downtown and stepping in front of one of the freight trains that run through town. In preparation, I deleted my Facebook account and texted her that I was fine and shut off my phone. I was tired and decided to take a nap, only to be woken up at 2 am by the university police who had been called by my ex. The next morning I had a meeting with a school counselor and it was suggested that I be admitted to a hospital for a few days to undergo observation. I was left in an unfamiliar place an hour from school with some of the most mentally unstable people I have ever met. My parents were notified about everything and came to get me after a week's stay in the hospital. My meds were changed and I got to go home for Christmas break. 

I had one relapse the first week back after an argument with my ex after she tried to check in on me. I tried to get her out of my life because I thought that it just made everything so much worse. I felt so guilty hours later when I tried to apologize to her and she wouldn't listen, that I sat in my bathroom with a gun to my head and just sobbed. That was supposed to have been the end. She called me up and found out what was going on and talked me down yet again. After this, things started to get better. I was working and had something to keep my mind off of my depression. I was going to counseling at home and things were pretty good at home. 

Last week everything came apart at the seems. My parents lashed out because I hadn't talked to them about what had happened at school. I have been afraid to tell them and just haven't been able to. We got into an argument and my dad came after me in the heat of it and grabbed me and told me to fight him. He shoved my mom out of the way when she tried to intervene and told her to stay out of his way. I said I was going to leave for the night because I didn't feel safe and they both said that I wasn't welcome back  and my funds for school were done as soon as I stepped out the door. They were my main source of financial support for school and I needed to go back. I wanted to go back mainly because I needed to prove to myself that I was capable of coming back from all of this. Things got patched up enough the night I left for school that they drove me to campus and agreed to help me out financially.

 I had to figure out how to make the first payment for the semester in time and register for classes as soon as I got back. I couldn't go to any classes the first day or so because of financials, but as soon as I could I didn't. I didn't go to classes the entire first week because I was afraid of both what people would ask about and afraid of just leaving my room. I have never been this way before in my life and I don't know what to do. I've basically stayed in bed all week because I'm too nervous to go to class, and now because I've missed so much class time I'm nervous to go confront my professors. I have this overwhelming anxiety that I feel like I can't deal with. I feel like I've failed every person that has tried to help me get back on my feet, but most importantly, I feel like I've failed me. I fought to get back to school and try and succeed and all I can do is sit in my room and fall back to the place I was in after Thanksgiving. I've fallen back into having suicidal thoughts and making plans more and more. I feel like I'm spiraling out of control again and like i'm losing my sanity too. I don't know what to do to help myself any more because nothing seems to help as long as I need it to.

809,How can I become a better streamer?,"Quick Note: Sorry for the long text but there was a lot I wanted to say. 

At first I started streaming as a joke but I found put quickly that games were so much more enjoyable with a chat. Now I want to try grow my community so we can get more active conversations in chat. Just having an audience makes me want to improve in all aspects of life.

I would like to know how I can improve my stream to draw more people in and provide a more enjoyable experience for my viewers. So far I have been streaming Garfield Kart, Minecraft, Valorant, and Don’t Starve Together. I have added an about section and a discord to help give my viewers a place to converse and get notified when I stream. 

I was wondering how could I improve? What games would you guys like to see me play? What types of things would you like me to add to my stream to make it more interesting or user friendly? I am asking you guys (r/teenagers) because you are my target audience and are the people that really help make a stream so much fun. So please, feel free to comment some suggestions and advice.

838,i want to die,"i recently got a therapist; my depression has been getting better. but this overwhelming sense of anxiety is consuming me. i’ve trying drinking lots of water, exercising, sleeping earlier—i’ve been trying to live a healthy lifestyle. i’m a sophomore in high school. my grades are so horrible. freshman year, i was a star student (i was probably the top of my class). i cant do it anymore. i’m so scared of my future. my parents are disappointed in me, as well as worried. i’m an asian person—so you could only imagine how much pressure i have to go through to get into a good college. it’s so overwhelming; everyday i think of suicide or violently hurting myself. i’m so tired. i’ve tried working harder so many times. nothing would get better. plus, i have to go to summer school to make up my horrible grades, and if my parents found out, i would only become a burden to my family. i don’t want to hear any bullshit like: “try your best, try talking to your family.” i just need someone to talk to."
839,My dad destroyed my life. I am at a dead end. Please read,"I am a 20 year old man now that can hardly function at all in all aspects of life. I live with my mom, have no ambitions, smoke weed every day, and I'm ugly. So here's a backstory because I really need to vent this as I feel like crying but physically can't.

My dad was an abusive man. He had borderline personality disorder and had a grandiosity complex, and treated my mother like she was our babysitter when I was growing up. Despite this, I was a very, very outgoing kid. I was quite handsome according to the girls at my school and my mothers friends, I was admired by many other kids, sometimes they tried to undermine me out of jealousy but I didn't care. I had a large group of friends in my neighborhood that looked up to me as a leader. I wasn't as shallow as I am now, as I befriended anyone and everyone I could. I even earned four 'character kid' awards throughout elementary school - an award you earn by other kids in your class voting for you.

I was sheltered big time by my controlling father. By the time I turned 8-9 years old, I was introduced to computers. I was entranced by videogames and this slowly began to overtake my life. My mom was kicked out around when I was 12 because of my dad, and basically near the end of elementary school, I was doing nothing but playing videogames in my house all day. My dad encouraged this and even bought me games and consoles as a way to keep me inside and away from the outside world.

When I entered middleschool, my dad started binge drinking very bad. He suffered depression himself, so this was his way to escape reality. This traumatized me as I was the one pulling him back to his bed and cleaning up his vomit before running back to my room to play videogames. I became a lot more reclusive in middleschool and had very few friends. Most of my friends moved out of my neighborhood so this made me even more isolated.

During highschool my dad was only getting worse and he picked up doing opioids after an arm injury. I got to a point around freshman year where all day at school I would put my hand on my face and sweat all class due to extreme, crippling social anxiety. Most of the time I would even try to sleep through class. I lost all my friends, and later on near sophomore year I lost my closest friends in the world after they told me I acted ""weird"" and ""alien"". This was because I feel like I lost a lot of emotion due to the trauma I faced and I tried to constantly compensate for this by saying cliche things that sounded almost robotic, and I would turn selectively mute around certain people. I spent all my freetime playing computer games.

So at 16 I had moved into my moms and her new boyfriends house. Slowly over time, due to a combination of poor diet, no excercise, bad habits, and just general aging, my good looks faded away. Me breaking my nose twice during my life didn't help, as this completely destroyed most of my upper face and actually moved my cheekbones so that my whole face is completely asymmetrical. My hair has become extremely thin and my hairline has receded a good inch. My jaw was corrected through surgery recently but my jawline is so steep that my face looks like a jalapeno. I know I sound like a shallow, self-centered piece of shit but these are things that flood my mind every day. All I do now is reminisce on how I used to look, and ruminate on how ugly I have become. I have never had a kiss because I was always embarassed when girls approached me when I was young. And I completely screwed up every chance I had. Now I have grown up to be ugly and my capacity for emotion has completely been stripped away. I am a toxic, neurotic, disgusting person. My dad has passed away and despite all of the havoc he has caused to my life, I still miss him so much and love him.

I am so lost. I am 20 now, turning 21 in June, I can hardly hold a grocery store job because of how bad my social anxiety is, I literally have 0 friends, I have gone from a very attractive kid to a freaky looking weirdo with a long monkey-looking face. I have lost my shining personality and now I am a husk of a human. I feel like ending my life every day. Is there ANY reason to keep going? I have no motivation, I feel anxiety even thinking about leaving the house, and I am now a fundementally lazy person."

841,I am a guy and was raped,"in 8th grade, I was big into smoking weed, like a lot more than I am now. some guy I kinda knew and had hung out with in a big group before invited me over to his place to go skate and smoke. I was like ok sure whatever you seem cool enough. so anyways we were talking in his room after skating, and he pulls out 2 joints. one for me and one for him. I didn't get sketched out by that but I should of (for those of you who don't know, it is stoner etiquette to share weed and the device you are using to smoke it). we smoked and I started feeling weird. I found out later mine was laced. The next thing I remember he was forcing me to have sex with him. I punched him, got my pants back on, and ran away, never telling anyone until a few months ago talking with my friends. I keep seeing him at the skatepark and he keeps trying to be friends with me and keeps DMing my friends trying to get my contact info. I hate him so much and he is acting like nothing ever happened! other people have come out and told me he raped them too and they were brave enough to report him but I'm too scared. this is my first time telling the full story so please don't get mad at me in the comments or anything it took a lot for me to share."

Well come late March, we both like each other, and I ask her out on a date. She agrees but on the condition that I go to prom with her (I was planning on asking her all along but she was just making sure she would have a date). I asked her out on a Monday, and we left for spring break on thay Wednesday. we never got to go on a daye and I won't see her again until Monday evening.

Hoping for him to poke deeper, let me tell him without having to actually come out and tell him. I want to tell someone, but I don't want to tell someone at the same time. Do you know what I mean? I want to die but it's such a lonely ride to get there. I don't want to be alone through this. That's all I feel. Alone. I am 22 and should be out socializing, living up my 20's but instead I spend all of my time alone in my room, on my computer, in my comfort zone, ""the internet"". It's so fucking pathetic but it's the only place where I feel interested in anything. I have no friends. I pushed them all away when I was younger in high school due to my extreme social anxiety. I never went to college. I see everyone I went to high school with posting graduation pictures and all these awesome accomplishments and I just feel so inadequate. I still live with my 65 year old mother, never started college, I work a part time job making next to nothing. I feel a lot of resentment towards my parents for the way they raised me. Never pushing me towards anything because they were too busy fighting. Never teaching me family values, never showing me how to be a productive member of society. I feel like such a disappointment and an embarrassment. I just feel like a lost cause. I know I had so much potential, I could have been someone great. I feel like I am too late in the game now to be great. I don't know why I'm even in here writing this. Right now, I'm laying in bed just sobbing and feeling so lonely. I stay up until I physically can't keep my eyes open anymore. I don't want to die but I don't want to exist. I just want it to end. I'm giving myself until October 1st. If my thoughts are not gone by then, I am going to go through with a final plan.

850,I crashed my mom's expensive new car...,"I didn't realize how strong her car was. It's an Acura TLX with the optional engine option. She always drove it on eco mode.


However, I turned on sports mode. I pressed the pedal how I would do on a normal Toyota Camry and it just went flying. The 290hp doesn't seem THAT much but holy shit that was fast. It's likely because my parents always accelerated slowly. Anyway, I accelerated so fast on a tight turn that I crashed into a parked truck.


Just a fender bender, you think? NO! It completely missed the crash bar (the bar behind the front and rear bumpers; connected to chassis to redirect the flow around the car or some shit) and crushed the engine. I'm sure it's totaled.

Watch for the signs or suffer the fate. Billions programed and goose steeping into oblivion. How high the lie to crush truth beneath its heel. Essence now needs its time in a maddening world of cancelation re-education and de population. One thought. One idea. One way for all and everyone to be. Or not to be.

859,How to earn money?,"Are you a teenager without money? 
Stop crying and follow these steps

1: Sell things your family maybe doesn't want 

When we changed our boiler i asked them if i could sell it and keep the profit ( if they don't give it for free ask some comission) and you can easily make money in this way.

When selling don't jump on every offer. Wait a little and then you can consider the best offer.  

On an old boiler i got 155 bucks which opened the second option


2: Invest into flipping

Don't be scared to flip things. 
Usually things like gaming consoles or shoes are easy to flip . 

Look at your local deals and do some research and flip for a higher price ( maybe 10 to 15 percent more but depends on what you buy and sell ) 

3: Sell snacks

Now this is for anyone who might have an actually chill school but selling snacks is fairly profitable. 
If you would sell 30 snacks and sell it 50  cents more than your buying price   that would make you 15 bucks per day. 

Be aware that chocolate type's of things are going to melt so aim for chips ( easier to flip)


4: Traditional mowing/extra chores

This is for the people that don't want to take risks and get a low but fair profit over time. 

Some times these chores can get you 100 bucks per month if you have the right people who would like to pay you. 

5: Flip cars ( If you are above 18 and know a little about cars ). 


Flipping cheap cars that may not start can give you up to 200 percent profit !!! 

Be aware that you do need tools and this is going to consume time and dedication since this style of flipping is about luck and speed !!!

Thnx for reading and don't mind giving other tips!!!!

877,Got back from a lonely day in a bachelorette party and felt like someone would want to read this to feel understood,"I looked for a post like this and did not find it, so here it is.

I (26F) am currently jobless and living at my parent's. I lost a job from covid and no other company calls back, even with a degree from a really good and known school. Have a boyfriend since 5y, but he lives too at his parent's waiting to spare enough money to leave even if he is in a very good stable position at work.
I'm chronically depressed but I nowadays manage the ""deep unrecognized sadness"" part quite good, I'm just hyper sensitive to negativity. 

So I went to the last day of a bachelorette weekend and every girl there had her own place with a job and a bf, half of them were married. And I felt soooo much like a burden to them even if I was invited. Impossible to answer questions about my life without making everyone embarassed to have asked, I felt like an adult stuck in a kid's life. On top of that I'm an introvert so the sexy-unapologetic-craziness of the bachelorette vibe hurt me a bit, as I was unable to fit in, and it was not acceptable to reject it - after all they all learned pretty intimate stuff about each other the day before so who am I to ruin the vibe by rejecting the inside jokes ? On top of the top of that, I did not share the same interests, and I have to pretend to be dumber that I am bcz I prefer make a fool of myself than making someone feel bad (so when someone engage in a subject and I know they are saying something very false, I don't respond or I just listen quietly until I find something right to jump on and.... maybe it's worse than being the know-it-all idk)

I'm exhausted and sad that I don't manage to fit in groups of girls, that I'm unable to strike a pose like them when it's photo time, to break my limits to have the same fun as them, or to have my limits met by the group (as in : not asking me questions about my private life).

And in spite of all of that : they liked having me ?!
So yeah maybe someone here would want to read that, just as I needed to read something like this, and know they aren't the only ones who feel lonely in a day full of friends."

879,I was almost happy this week!,"Hi, first time poster here.

I feel like this is probably a stupid thing to share, but I’ve had a rough decade and happy moments seem so fleeting. I got my first hair cut in 2 years and 7 months 2 days ago. I think it took me so long because of laziness, indecisiveness and also partially because I very, very seldomly treat myself to these sorts of things. My hair cut looked pretty good and it was only 30 bucks! I went to the bag shop next door and impulse bought myself a new wallet for $20 (it was 30% off.) I’ve had my old wallet for 11 years and it desperately needed an upgrade. I was grinning like an idiot the entire walk back to the car. I was halfway home when something just switched in my brain. All I could think is “God, you’re fucking stupid. You could have been this happy years ago and it would have only cost 50 bucks”. Then it turned into “God, you’re fucking stupid. You’re meant to have a haircut every 2 months, not every 2 years”. THEN it turned into “God, you’re fucking stupid. These ‘things’ are not real happiness, it’s just a fleeting, short-term distraction and a waste of money”.

By the time I made the 10 minute drive home I was miserable again. It’s a bit annoying when I know I’m capable of happiness, but that ‘light switch’ thing happens in my head and my brain just seems to shut it down in an instant. Then I just sit in my car, on my driveway staring through the windscreen with no desire to leave the car or continue my day. I just sit and stare.

I don’t even know what the point of this story is, sorry! I just got so excited about being happy. It feels good to feel good! Hopefully it’ll last a little longer next time."

882,Going to be a freshman in two weeks! Terrified but excited.,"I've been using Khan Academy on and off during the summer to aid in my learning (Angle Bisector theorem is hard to understand though, and I'm also struggling a bit with physics) but other than that, it's been a pretty smooth ride. I suppose I've got a bit of advice I've learned throughout my life up until this point that I'd like to share, for madlads, madlasses, or whatever epic entity you identify as. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Don't be afraid to speak up if you've been bullied or made uncomfortable.** It doesn't matter who's making you uncomfortable or bullying you. It can be a teacher, it can be a younger student: SPEAK UP. My preschool teacher excluded me from many activities because I had autism, and thought I was 'weird'. I was too scared to speak up and it wasn't until I moved to another town to go to a middle school that anybody else knew. That's not to say that students can't make you uncomfortable either: as teens, we're all going through some pretty weird stuff right now, we're feeling new emotions and our bodies are changing. That being said, we might feel anxious to speak up in fear of being weird when a student has made us feel uncomfortable or bullied us. *Confront the student, you don't need any more stress than you're already going through.*

**Don't let yourself get pressured by anybody into making the wrong friends.** Maybe you thought those kids were cool. In my case (which is still happening), my parents are trying to make me change who I am as a person so that I can be more likable to students and have more friends. Everybody has a different definition for what constitutes a friend, but in my opinion, they should be understanding, supportive, and (optional) share interests with you (they also shouldn't tell you all the answers to your homework, that's for you to do!). Friends shouldn't talk behind you about your back, and you shouldn't do that to them either. Sometimes, friends grow apart, and that's okay. That can happen, and while it can hurt, if you stayed, it'd just be a weird thing, and meaningless. Ack.

**Keep up with school, get help as often as you can.** My shyness got in the way of me asking a very smart friend for help in math, and I had a failing grade for 2 months. I got it back up by myself, but it would have saved me a lot of panicked nights if I had just asked for help, paid more attention in class, and utilized your resources. Websites like Khan Academy are very helpful (there's even a handy-dandy app!) and serve as great out-of-class tools. If your school offers it, you could also go to a tutoring session. We all have a subject we've got trouble understanding, whether it be math or science, you've got help out there. Also try not to procrastinate. Leave your unnecessary devices (stop checking if you got an upvote on reddit! to parents or turn them off. Set a time limit (a reasonable one of course, enough to correctly do your task and review what needs to be reviewed) and reduce television and video game time. Cringy 10 year old me who loved Roblox and .io games to absolute death suffered the consequences. Don't be like 10 year old me.

**It's not healthy to bottle up your emotions.** I'm a rare case, but during a time where edgy 12 year old me was going through the emotions and actually got a bit depressed, I had nobody in real life to vent to (I didn't have any friends... yet), so I turned to my online friends. Online friends are definitely cool and good, I have lots of them! However, there's only so much you can tell them, and only so much they can relate to. Vent every once in a while, maybe go to the counselor (they keep your information confidential unless it's a suicide related thing iirc) if you feel like you have to. Friends are coolio.

**Hygiene and organization goes a long, long way.** My parents have brought me up to be a clean person, both with my possessions and with my body. Always have essential items accessible to the place where you do your schoolwork, and personal items in your room/bathroom (or however it goes on your house). Having a clean room is nice in general, it is more pleasant to look at, and waking up to it is just great. Nice and tidy, you know where everything is! Taking care of your body is also important. While you boys may think ""holy hecc that's too gIrLy"" and I definitely understand where you are coming from, using products such as lotion or stuff to exfoliate can really improve your outwards appearance, and you'll probably feel more confident about yourself. I know from experience that exfoliating can help a lot with clear skin, and lotion keeps away that ashy skin. Don't be embarrassed! There are mens products for this believe it or not, so you won't be stuck with using ""lavender unicorn meadows exfoliating scrub."" Also, it's important to shower regularly.

**Discover yourself.** So maybe you won't be the very best, like no one ever was. Whatever, Ash reserved that privilege anyway. Find out what you like and don't like. Like sports? Coolio! Like k-pop? Also coolio, that's who you are as a person! Are you an insane daft punk fan who somewhat enjoys doing their *Homework and making a Discovery that they are Human After All?* No? Just me? Whatever. You find you, and don't change yourself for others. If you like fortnite, you like fortnite, and that is OKAY. Love what you love, and love yourself. As Daft Punk themselves said:  


If love is the answer, you're home."
883,I give up. I'll never amount to anything,"I turned 19 on the 1st and I already have nothing. No GED, no license, no money. No talent. I cant even get accepted as the gender I want to be. I give up. I will never get commissioned, I will never get hired anywhere. My art will never take me anywhere in life. I see so many videos of where someone gets offered their dream job, or someone's talent gets shared and then they blow up and have a ton of people supporting them. That will never be me, no one sees me. No one cares. I will never get that break. My art has never gone anywhere and it never will. I can see the disappointment in my parent's faces and hear it in their voices. I think about dying. They'll be free from the financial burden I am. They say it's fine, but I know it's not. I don't want them to suffer from my uselessness anymore. I wish I had talent, I wish I could do something with my art. I want to make art for video games. But I know it'll never happen. I wish someone out there would see me"

890,I’m drowning,"Hi everyone 

It’s crazy how life changes so drastically.

My parents abused any and all traces of self esteem out of me by the time I turned 19.

What used to be the friendliest and extraverted kid in school shrivelled into a rotting ball of self hatred and destructiveness.

Here I am at 20 now
The only thing that is keeping me going is the gym and what I might achieve physically.

I’m scared to talk to people, consumed by the idea that even being remotely near someone would make them burn with immense hatred.

I look in the mirror and wish to be someone else, I see my face as a trainwreck and my body as trash.

I’m starting a new job tomorrow, yay!
Give it a week and I’ll fall into a spiral of negativity and hate every shift.

I’m paranoid about making friends, I haven’t made any for a few years. The concept is foreign to me.

I don’t know what to do. Nobody close to me cares, I’m on my own with this.

Good night"

MY MIDDLE SCHOOL HAS A CLOSED CAMPASS. It makes sence for the 5th graders, sence technically they should be in elementary school, but the people in 9th grade suffer from this, who (from what I understand from the rest of Canada, and the U.S) should be in High school. 

In highschool, we got the ultimate freedom, and that is the ability to skip class, and go to Circle K (Or not and just go during lunch) So much freedom, Thank god.

895,*UPDATE* What happened yesterday night after I had submitted my post...,"So there I was, just as I had said, I actually stood on the chair with the loop of the nooce around my neck anywhere from 15-25minutes. There’s a spot nearby my house that isn’t too far and luckily it was that cold yesterday night. Was able to sneak out without making a noise and attempt suicide. Nobody IRL knows about my posts on Reddit and yesterday’s pathetic attempt. I got super scared, I didn’t have the courage, I wasn’t brave enough. I’ve thought about perhaps illegally acquiring a firearm (not sure how) or setting myself ablaze. Until next time, I shall try again."

897,I’m at a crossroad,"I’m 16(m) from Finland and I’ve been depressed  for almost 8 years because I’ve realized that my family of dad, mom, little sister and little brother do not care for me.

I’m overweight (112kg, 175cm), I spent half a year and over 400€ with a girl who said she never loved me (we were not arguing at the time) I can’t talk to a psychiatrist, because I can’t keep my stuff when I would go to the temporary home. I constantly joke about suicide to the couple friends I have, I don’t feel safe at home and the safest feeling place for me is at my hotbox place, because I’ve been smoking marijuana for the last year to ease the pain (It has helped), and that is in the woods and only at night.

So, the question is, Do I kill myself to stop the pain, do I kill my dad and see where it goes or  do I push through the pain and make sure that they can’t contact me ever when I go to live alone.

902,Can we please stop with the whole “people only care about depression if you’re a girl” thing?,"The whole idea is harmful and it’s just so fucking dumb. Not all girls that are depressed exploit it for attention. One of my friends cut, because she thought people found out that she had cut before, the thought of people finding out she was depressed made her way more depressed. A lot of girls will hide it because they don’t want to be perceived as sad and not fun to be around. And it’s not like if you’re a guy you’re incapable of receiving support and comfort. If anything it has more to do with guys not wanting to talk about their feelings more than anything else. I don’t really talk about personal issues like that with any of my guy friends but I feel completely alright with it with my female friends. If you’re a dude there’s lots of people out there that will support you, and being a girl wouldn’t mean you’d get showered with love just for being depressed. It’s so fucking far off from reality...."

I have dreams, hopes, and wishes, but none of it is possible when you combine the world we live in with the laws of the universe. I don’t want to be in this plane of existence. The only thing that gives me hope is death. Death may allow me to be free, as long as I’m more than flesh and bones. However, I don’t know anything beyond this, and it kills me. I already know that continuing in this world is not a battle worth fighting, so it’s not in the cards for me. But what will death bring me? Will my soul have another shot at freedom, or not? Is there any hope, or is the universe too big to give a damn? Am I destined to just suffer until my consciousness no longer exists? Why does it have to be like this?

My SO is my world, and we've been together for four years. He loves me very much, but recently he ha seen diagnosed with severe depression. We live near each other, but spend most of the year separated due to the fact we go to different educational institutions. 

Lately, his depression has been really severe. And he is distant, and we don't talk like we used to, and we've been arguing much more than usual.

We have a mutual friend who acts as a liaison since they have personally dealt with depression before, but it is so frustrating that I can't seem to do anything the help my own relationship. I've never felt this hopeless, and it breaks my heart to see him and us in the state we are now. I wish I could explain more, but it's so complex and I realize that I just have to understand the fact that I'll never know what he is going through, or be able to fix it. I'm just looking for advice or suggestions to help me deal with it, and in turn, be a better support system to my SO, because he deserves it. Thanks for letting me get this out, Reddit.

920,[Rant] Everybody is so judgmental &amp; Going with the flow.,"To start, I want to clarify something. When I say ""Going with the flow,"" I don't mean conformity.


Anyways, I have been noticing lately that I have been having increasing feelings of misanthropy in me. I don't think it's going to get to the point of complete social isolation and an all encompassing distaste for any human being who happens to cross my path, but I have been noticing an increasing amount of people i can't really talk to anymore because I just don't care anymore about what the have to say. 

A majority of the people, for example that I talk to are gamers. Personally, I lack the time and the interest to play video games anymore, with two or three exceptions. What really made me start changing mentally was when I told my friends I was going to get a laptop. This was back in November or so, right around the time when Battle Field 4, came out, I think. The reason I mention that is because I had to endure someone telling me ad nauseam that my computer would not be able to handle said game, even after I mentioned that I have no intention of playing it (I still don't). I found it curious that somebody who was constantly being bullied, and well aware of it, seemed to be almost mocking me for my choice of laptop. Even somebody like him could be so judgmental.


It was maybe a month or two later, at a lacrosse game, that I realized something. I was also judgmental, at one point in my life. Through my changing ideals, I had become more misanthropic, but much less judgmental. A rather obnoxious man and his wife sit in front of my brother and I, and he talks to us. Although we are annoyed by him, and we are both season ticket holders, so we see him at every game, I realized that I really have no problem with him at all. Whilst in the middle of a high-five with him after a goal, I realized that this made him truly happy. He has something that he truly gets excited about, and that, to me, made everything okay. The fact that he has something that makes him happy, makes me happy.



So how does this relate to everybody being judgmental? Well, I started to start notice that people in my school have these things that make them happy, so I have been much less judgmental since my quasi-epiphany. That seems counter-intuitive to an increasing level of misanthropy, doesn't it? the answer is, quite frankly, no. Just like the kid mocking my laptop choice,  many people are so judgmental. Approaching things with a go-with-the-flow attitude adds a sort of *je ne sais quois* to life. I have stopped talking to most of my friends, but I have made a small amount of new ones who share the same laid back attitude in regards to peoples' actions and choices. You should try it."

934,Feeling a lot of stuff,"Basically I'm entering High school (14, Grade 9) and there's a lot going on.  My older brother is entering college this year (next week actually) and I'm afraid I'll be known as that kid who was the younger brother of the popular guy.  Then there's me and my GF (14m, 13f) and I'm kinda worried since we don't go to the same schools and we only see each other a max 2 times a week and it really sucks especially now for the summer since I'm away.  I guess it's hard for us to date since some people won't like it (religious families) and our older brothers were best friends during HS so it's gonna be awkward.  

Then there's my social anxiety and depression which sucks.  My family moved to another country right before i entered middle school so I made up a new persona that I thought was better than my regular self and I stuck with it.  And it seriously is shitty when I want to be how I really am but there's always doubt when I think about it.  

Then I have issues with bottling stuff up since to my dad in the real world people don't cry. People don't let their emotions out. People shouldn't be so sensitive and thats all I've really known and I guess that's why i find it so hard to open up since there's such a huge stigma behind the ""guy who is sensitive and doesnt act like a real fucking man and.  I'm done. (Just to clear things up I don't want to kill myself)

I have no fucking clue what's going on and my shitty self is feeling worse and worse as I go on.

935,Story/advice time!,"So leaving school today I was walking home through the forest to get home with my crush because we live close to each other. I had taken her on a date the past Saturday so I thought she liked me (which her friend said to my friend she did but that's a story for another time.)  When out of the blue this sweaty overweight black freshman came out of the woods with his face drenched in sweat. He had to be at least 6,2 and 300+ pounds.  He knew her and needed help getting through the woods so we walked with him out of the woods for like 5 minutes.  We were crossing a creek when he said something along the lines of ""So what are you guys?  Brother and sister?  Dating?  Just friends?""  We had only been on one date so I  didn't really know what to say.  After like 2 seconds she said ""just friends""  she is sort of shy so I wasn't sure if she actually just wants to be friends or just didn't want to tell this person she knew we were some where in the middle.  Any thoughts?  But the true moral of the story is when ever there is some sort of awkward silence or what ever, just have a big sweaty black guy come out of the woods looking for directions!"

After everyone left the house except for my family members and my cousins to which they are staying for the whole night, I quickly ask myself ""hey its my birthday I should masturbating to make it the best bday ever"" I quickly got into my room with the lube that I bought and started doing my thing and then...all of my family members opened the door which I forgot to lock and shouted""HAPPY BIRTHDA-"" I said ""ITS NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE"" and some of them laugh and my dad said ""its OK, let us know when you're done"" I didnt finished it obviously I was ASHAMED I quickly went downstairs and they shouted ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY!""

944,I'm tired of living,"  I'm tired of living.

  That's it, that's all.

  I'll soon be 21 years old, but I feel the better part of my life has been wasted and there's no chance for me anymore.

  I can't name a single friend that I can be sure will be there for me when I'm down like this, because there has never been anybody.

  I've never had a partner, never had intercourse or anything of that kind.

  I've been jobless for all my life, never was good enough for even the lower-grade part time jobs.

  I study in university and boast how satisfied with my education I am, but on the inside I know it's all a bunch of bull\*\*\*t and I can never bring myself to rationalizing the point of cramming all the useless information, so I can't even study.

  I live in a dorm and can barely stand my roommates, no matter how decent they are. I just want to be alone, but whenever I'm alone, I just go bonkers.

  Nothing interests me. I can barely focuse on a book; no matter how many times I listen to a record, it just goes through my ears and games are just... not fun. I carefully pick good movies to watch, but would rather do anything else, while watching them. No other hobbies or passions.

  This is what I notice, ""I would rather do anything else, but *blank*"". It's a statement in my head that applies to everything.

  I can't go to bed, but can't wake up. I'm hungry and sit down to eat, but I have the dependency. I worry about money, but spend it mindlessly, which fills me with even more guilt and regret. I buy the overly-priced thing, but then never use it.

I started taking it for dissociation and now that *that* is somewhat managed I am a fucking hopeless and nervous wreck all the time. I didn't realize that it was possible to be depressed and anxious at the same time. Everything is so exhausting. I am incapable of doing what I usually do in a normal day now. When I push myself as fast as I can go, I don't get things done fast enough for anyone else. But at the same time, I am extremely reluctant to let them know what is going on. And the only people I have told think that I just need to try harder. The futility really gets to me. It seems so smalls, but it doesn't go anywhere and it's weight adds up day after day. 
"
954,I can hear her sobbing.,"As a child I was never comforted when I cried over the pettiest things. Even when I got bullied, my mom scolded me for even showing the weakest emotion. When I didn't pass my scholarship, cried for hours, got scolded. I guess she was trying to show tough love. I don't know. 

I concluded that based from these experiences, I shouldn't show weakness in front of her. During my first break up, I cried in my room alone. Even if I want to vent everything to her, I can't because I know I'll get scolded. Even during my darkest depression episode, to the point that I was suicidal, I decided not to tell. I've kept it all to myself. All these years.

Just right now as I'm typing this, I can hear her sobbing.

I don't know the reason. I'm clueless. It's even my first time hearing it. But even if I want to comfort her and take care of her from whatever she's crying about, I can't do it. I can't. I don't know why. I can't bring myself to comfort her. I love her and I want her to stop crying and be happy but, I just can't, I don't know how. My body can't bring myself there and do all those things. I don't have the courage. I'm stuck.

When I used to cry at school because I can't cry it at all at home, I was thankful I had great friends who comforted me. And now during quarantine, even if we are miles apart, I still manage to send them words of encouragement during their hard times. But with my mom who is just in the other room crying, I can't bring myself to do it.

Funny how things turn around. Now it feels like I'm the bad person."
955,Depression and a spouse with a chronic illness,"Hey guys, this is my first post here so I hope I'm not breaking any etiquette. I don't know how to have friends so I hope you guys can at least listen to me. 

I've been depressed basically my whole life, it's always just been a part of me. But I've also had periods of relative remission where I've been able to get my shit together.

The last six months or so have been bad. In the previous year, I'd lost weight and felt like I wasn't physically repulsive for the first time in my life and was a Dean's List student. I was feeling pretty good about myself most of the time. But I've lost all of that, and it feels awful to be at the bottom again and have to work my way out.

All of this brings me to yesterday. In the morning we were advised by our doctor to stop looking for treatments for my wife's chronic pain and other problems, that there was no cure and the best thing to do is seek cognitive behavioural therapy. To just learn to live with it.

Because of my wife's condition, she's in pain all the time. Incredible pain. She's tough as fuck. But it makes things hard. We don't have sex anymore and I can barely touch her. It makes me feel undesirable and alone all of the time, which I think is what's at the heart of my spiralling. But at the same time none of it is her fault, so what am I supposed to do? There's this amorphous frustration and sadness inside me but there's nowhere to direct it so it turns inwards. I tell myself I deserve it, that of course this is where I ended up in life because I've always been an unfuckable loser. 

That same day I bombed an essay I'd submitted and my professor spent 45 minutes explaining line by line why I'm a terrible writer. It was hard to keep it together and I cried in the bathroom for like 30 minutes. Obviously I was extra sensitive because of the news earlier in the day but it still gutted me. My self talk was always pretty fucked, but it always went something like yeah you're ugly and weird and dumb dude but at least you're a pretty good writer. Now I've got that guys voice in my head instead. It's brutal. (He was right, in any event. I put no effort into that paper and it was shit.) I then went on to bomb another exam that evening. It was a hard day.

I've been pretty much sitting in a sorta stunned depression ever since. I don't know how to deal emotionally with my situation. Cause I love my wife more than anything, but I basically can't talk to her about this cause she blames herself for all of it. Which I don't want cause it isn't her fault. And since everything is always worse for her, I feel dumb complaining. But I feel awful and even worse knowing that things won't get any better, that she will suffer like this for the rest of her life. I feel selfish being upset by it but I am. It's not fair to her and it isn't fair to me. It sucks. It makes me feel hopeless and helpless.

I think the only reason I haven't thought about suicide much is the meds I'm on that make everything feel sorta the same. So I don't even really feel down in the way I'm used to. I just feel numb. I need help.

Sorry, thank you."

968,Trouble with some kids,"So there is this girl who recently broke up with her boyfriend. She is a very good friend of mine as well. Today at school, she sat next to me in class throughout the day(We all stay in the same class throughout the day and it is the teachers who come to the class for different subjects). There were these two kids sitting on the seat in front of us and they were constantly looking back and smiling at us. We did not mind this whole thing all day but then at the end of the day I see those two kids talking to my friend's ex-boyfriend and it was obvious they were talking about us. When I glanced at them talking, the ex told me to fuck off right away. I went up to them and asked what was wrong. One of my friends told me that they were actually talking about me and one of the two kids admitted as well. I usually avoid dealing with back-biters but the thing here was that those two kids were acting like fucking spies for this asshole and then they are the ones to act like shit with me. **(**A note- these two kids are the butt of jokes of the class and they get bullied by that same guy they were reporting to, smiling.  I have never had any trouble with them, in fact I have never participated in harassing these kids when the other kids did and have stood up for both of them in some situations at one point of time, now they are acting like dogs to this asshole kid.**)** So after I walked up to them I told the two kids that I do not mind you acting like a messenger to your bully but this spy shit has to stop. After that one of them refused to have said anything about me and blamed everything to his partner, his partner on the other hand accepted that they were talking about me but it was his partner who asked him to join him. After making his part clear he said and I am quoting,""I will still tell him everything, do whatever you can."", meanwhile the ex was just standing there(btw he is one of those stereotypical asshole jocks with a lot of backup friends to help him in a fight). His saying all of that was really infuriating so I lost my temper for a moment and I just remember arguing with him loudly and telling him to mind his own fucking business. The argument broke up with both of us telling each other to fuck off. This shit has taken up my mind since I have got home. I know that the ex did not really ask them to tell him anything in the first place but know I am pretty sure that the two kids have been instructed to spy on us and they surely will for the dogs they are. I am not one bit afraid of the ex but this whole back-biting thing and spy shit is intolerable. I realize now that I should have played it cool at school and let them talk about me and my friend but then just knowing the fact that someone is standing behind your back and listening to your conversations and then reporting them is annoying and irritating, and I do not want this thing to grow at all. What should I do about all this?"
969,What harmless thing your parents do scares the shit outta you?,"- Asking me what I’m doing, it always feels like they’re going to accuse me of something 

- Talking loudly, like at all

- yelling at each other, yo I get stuck in the crossfire

- whenever they get angry at my siblings, like i know im probably going to be next, or they’re going to take it out on me."
970,40th birthday today,Today is my 40th birthday (m) and I feel like my life is over. I am an old dude now. So depressing...
971,"Fuck one, marry one, kill one.","I'll start:

Katy Perry
Ariana Grande
Nicki Minaj

I would kill Katy Perry
Fuck Nicki Minaj
Marry Ariana Grande"
972,Fuck everything,"Fuck stupid college and relationships and friends and people and most importantly fuck this shitty stupid life and a dysfunctional brain

I am so done with everything, everytime I try to care of myself and get better something happens, like the entire universe is trying to get rid of me

I am officially done with everything and I don't give a fuck about myself or my life, if I have to disappoint everyone, so be it

I can't keep pretending anymore for the sake of others, I am D O N E and I don't want to do this anymore

I've been depressed my whole life and I am damaged beyond repair, this disease will kill me and I know it, there's just no hope and that's a fact"
